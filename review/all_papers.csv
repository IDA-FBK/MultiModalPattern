The VDI provides personalized, real-time feedback to students in a driving simulator, addressing some of the limitations of traditional driver instruction. Employing a hybrid AI system, the VDI combines rule-based agents, learning-based agents, knowledge graphs, and Bayesian networks to assess and monitor student performance in a comprehensive manner. Implemented in multiple simulators at a driving school in Norway, the system aims to leverage AI and driving simulation to improve both the learning experience and the efficiency of instruction. Initial feedback from students has been largely positive, highlighting the effectiveness of this integration while also pointing to areas for further improvement. This marks a significant stride in infusing technology into driver education, offering a scalable and efficient approach to instruction. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, effectively leveraging multi-modal data sources to enhance defect detection performance remains challenging. This paper presents a novel Knowledge Graph-based Multimodal Neural Network (KGMNN) approach for robust and efficient defect detection in smart grids. Our proposed method first leverages multiple heterogeneous data sources, such as structural data, temporal sensor readings, and maintenance records, creating a comprehensive representation of the grid system. The system is then modeled as a knowledge graph, with nodes representing various entities and edges signifying their interconnections and interactions. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture that effectively leverages the knowledge graph structure. This architecture incorporates multi-modal fusion techniques, enabling the model to process and integrate diverse data sources. It can recognize intricate patterns indicative of potential defects that are often undetectable in individual data modes. Experimental results on several real-world smart grid datasets demonstrate that the KGMNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the KGMNN's ability to provide explainable predictions, aided by the inherent interpretability of the knowledge graph structure, is of significant practical value in the field. This research paves the way for a new generation of AI-powered defect detection in smart grids, facilitating enhanced grid reliability and operational efficiency. © 2023 The Authors.

Operationalizing the BSM into research and clinical care is challenging because most investigators work in silos that concentrate on only one or two BSM domains. Furthermore, the expanding, multidisciplinary nature of BSM research creates practical limitations as to how individual investigators integrate current data into their processes of generating impactful hypotheses. The rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for organizing knowledge, but the practical aspects for how AI may advance LBP research and clinical are beginning to be explored. The goals of the work presented here are to: (1) explore the current capabilities of knowledge integration technologies (large language models (LLM), similarity graphs (SGs), and knowledge graphs (KGs)) to synthesize biomedical literature and depict multimodal relationships reflected in the BSM, and; (2) highlight limitations, implementation details, and future areas of research to improve performance. We demonstrate preliminary evidence that LLMs, like GPT-3, may be useful in helping scientists analyze and distinguish cLBP publications across multiple BSM domains and determine the degree to which the literature supports or contradicts emergent hypotheses. We show that SG representations and KGs enable exploring LBP's literature in novel ways, possibly providing, trans-disciplinary perspectives or insights that are currently difficult, if not infeasible to achieve. The SG approach is automated, simple, and inexpensive to execute, and thereby may be useful for early-phase literature and narrative explorations beyond one's areas of expertise. Likewise, we show that KGs can be constructed using automated pipelines, queried to provide semantic information, and analyzed to explore trans-domain linkages. The examples presented support the feasibility for LBP-tailored AI protocols to organize knowledge and support developing and refining trans-domain hypotheses. © 2023 The Authors.

By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function, KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic forgetting. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Knowledge graph; Neuro-symbolic; Transfer learning,Classification (of information); Embeddings; Entropy; Graph neural networks; Pattern recognition; Cross entropy; Embeddings; Graph neural networks; Image data; Knowledge graphs; Learn+; Neural-networks; Neuro-symbolic; Transfer learning; Visual model; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Since it requires a deep semantic and linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires multi-modal reasoning from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose Graphhopper, a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Concretely, our method is based on performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show that we keep up with human performance on manually curated scene graphs. Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene graph reasoning model on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs by a significant margin. © 2021, The Author(s).",Knowledge graph reasoning; Multi-modal reasoning; Reinforcement learning; Scene graph reasoning; Visual Question Answering (VQA),Autonomous agents; Computer vision; Natural language processing systems; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Knowledge graph reasoning; Knowledge graphs; Modal reasoning; Multi-hops; Multi-modal; Multi-modal reasoning; Question Answering; Scene graph reasoning; Scene-graphs; Visual question answering; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Prior work on IMs has focused on analyzing their spread over time or high-level classification tasks like hate speech detection, while a principled analysis of their stratified semantics is missing. Hypothesizing that Semantic Web technologies are appropriate to help us bridge this gap, we build the first Internet Meme Knowledge Graph (IMKG): an explicit representation with 2 million edges that capture the semantics encoded in the text, vision, and metadata of thousands of media frames and their adaptations as memes. IMKG is designed to fulfil seven requirements derived from the inherent characteristics of IMs. IMKG is based on a comprehensive semantic model, it is populated with data from representative IM sources, and enriched with entities extracted from text and vision connected through background knowledge from Wikidata. IMKG integrates its knowledge both in RDF and as a labelled property graph. We provide insights into the structure of IMKG, analyze its central concepts, and measure the effect of knowledge enrichment from different information modalities. We demonstrate its ability to support novel use cases, like querying for IMs that are based on films, and we provide insights into the signal captured by the structure and the content of its nodes.

Subnetworks that are relevant to the classification (referred to as “disease subnetworks”) are detected using explainable AI. Federated learning is enabled by dividing the knowledge graph into relevant subnetworks, constructing an ensemble classifier, and allowing domain experts to analyze and manipulate detected subnetworks using a developed user interface.

Hence, this research identifies and describes the modes of interaction between them. Furthermore, a “cloud-driven” interaction mode which focuses on fully maximising cloud computing characteristics and benefits for driving the semantic web is described, providing an approach for evolving the semantic web and delivering automated semantic annotation on a large scale to web applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Cloud computing; Cloud driven; Semantic annotation; Semantic cloud; Semantic technologies; Semantic web,Cloud computing; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud platforms; Developing solutions; Diverse fields; Interaction modes; Semantic annotations; Semantic technologies; WEB application; Semantic Web,FALSE

This is because these models rely solely on the patterns and relationships present in the training data, and may not be able to effectively incorporate additional knowledge about the relationships between medical entities. To address this issue, we introduce KG-MultiResCNN— K nowledge G uided Multi -filter Res idual C onvolutional N eural N etwork model, which combines training examples with external knowledge from the Wikidata Knowledge Graph (KG) in order to better capture the relationships between medical entities. The KG is a structured database that contains a wealth of information about various entities, including medical concepts and their relationships with one another. By incorporating this external knowledge into our model, we are able to improve its ability to predict ICD codes for new clinical texts. In our experiments with the MIMIC-III dataset, we found that the KG-MultiResCNN model significantly outperformed the baseline approaches. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using external knowledge, in addition to training examples, to improve the performance of deep learning models for automatic ICD coding. © 2023, The Author(s).",Automatic ICD Coding; Computer-Aided Diagnosis; Embedding Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge Guided Convolutional Neural Networks; Medical Entity Relationships,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Embeddings; Knowledge graph; Network coding; Automatic ICD coding; Convolutional neural network; Embedding knowledge graph; Embeddings; Entity-relationship; External knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge guided convolutional neural network; Medical entity relationship; Training example; Computer aided diagnosis,FALSE

However, users are often not interested in finding all objects, but only those that pertain to a small set of categories or concepts. Nowadays, the standard approach to solve this task involves initially employing an object detector to identify all objects within the image, followed by refining the outcomes to retain only the ones of interest. Nevertheless, the object detector does not take advantage of the user’s prior intent that, when used, can potentially improve the detection performance of the model. This work presents a method to condition an existing object detector with the user’s intent, encoded as one or more concepts from the WordNet graph, to find just those objects of interest. The proposed approach takes advantage of existing datasets for object detection without the need for new annotations, and it allows to adapt the already existing object detector models with minor changes.

Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based representation in drug repurposing, encoding entities and relations to predict new connections and facilitate drug discovery. As COVID-19 has become a major public health concern, it is critical to establish an appropriate COVID-19 KG for drug repurposing to combat the spread of the virus. However, most publicly available COVID-19 KGs lack support for multi-relations and comprehensive entity types. Moreover, none of them originates from COVID-19-related drugs, making it challenging to identify effective treatments. To tackle these issues, we developed Drug-CoV, a drug-origin and multi-relational COVID-19 KG. We evaluated the quality of Drug-CoV by performing link prediction and comparing the results to another publicly available COVID-19 KG. Our results showed that Drug-CoV outperformed the comparing KG in predicting new links between entities.

However, the platform needs to achieve bi-directional recommendation in many real-world scenarios. For example, in an online recruitment scenario, the recommender system not only needs to recommend positions to candidates, but also recommend candidates to enterprises. In this paper, we develop a new bi-directional recommendation model for online recruitment termed (BiMuF) Bi-directional recommendation with Multi-semantic Filter. In BiMuF, an encoder component is utilized to learn the text embeddings, a multi-semantic filter component is designed to capture important graph representation, and a graph learning component is designed to learn the graph embeddings. In addition, a multi-task learning framework is designed to achieve bi-directional recommendations. In the multi-task learning framework, we share text embeddings and graph embeddings to alleviate the problems of data sparsity, data asymmetry, and feature generalization in online recruitment.

VL models have reached unprecedented performances by extending the idea of Transformers, so that both modalities can learn from each other. Massive pre-training procedures enable VL models to acquire a certain level of real-world understanding, although many gaps can be identified: the limited comprehension of commonsense, factual, temporal and other everyday knowledge aspects questions the extendability of VL tasks. Knowledge graphs and other knowledge sources can fill those gaps by explicitly providing missing information, unlocking novel capabilities of VL models.

Knowledge Graphs (KGs), consisting of real-world objective facts and fruitful entities, play a vital role in recommender systems. Recently, a technological trend has been to develop end-to-end Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based knowledge-aware recommendation (a.k.a., Knowledge Graph Recommendation, KGR) models. Unfortunately, current GNNs-based KGR approaches focus on how to capture high-order feature information on KGs while neglecting the following two crucial limitations: 1) The explicitly high-order feature interaction and fusion mechanism and 2) The valid user intent modelling mechanism. As such, these issues lead to insufficient user/item representation learning capability and unsatisfactory KGR performance. In this work, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Re commendation with F eature I nteraction and Intent-aware Attention Networks (FIRE) to address the latent intent modelling and high-order feature interaction deficiencies ignored by existing KGR methods. Based on the prototype user/item representation learning leveraging the GNNs-based approach, our model offers the following major improvements: One is the innovative use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that perform vertical convolutional (a.k.a., bit-level convolutional) and horizontal convolutional (a.k.a., vector-level convolutional) processes to model multi-granular high-order feature interactions to enhance item-side representation learning. Another is to model users’ latent intent factors by utilizing a two-level attention mechanism (i.e., node- and intent-level attention mechanism) to enhance user-side representation learning. Extensive experiments on three KGs domain public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baseline.

Another prominent research field that has been benefiting from the adoption of KGs is that of Recommender Systems (RSs). Feeding a RS with data coming from a KG improves recommendation accuracy, diversity, and novelty, and paves the way to the creation of interpretable models that can be used for explanations. This possibility of combining a KG with a RS raises the question whether such an addition can be performed in a plug-and-play fashion – also with respect to the recommendation domain – or whether each combination needs a careful evaluation. To investigate such a question, we consider all possible combinations of (i) three recommendation tasks (books, music, movies); (ii) three recommendation models fed with data from a KG (and in particular, a semantics-aware deep learning model, that we discuss in detail), compared with three baseline models without KG addition; (iii) two main encyclopedic KGs freely available on the Web: DBpedia and Wikidata.

In this work, we tackle the novel task of associating images from Wikipedia pages with the correct caption among a large pool of available ones written in multiple languages, as required by the image-caption matching Kaggle challenge organized by the Wikimedia Foundation.

Previous work in multimodal sentiment analysis have focused on the representation and fusion of modalities, capturing the underlying semantic relationships between modalities by considering contextual information. While this approach is feasible for simple contextual comments, more complex comments require the integration of external knowledge to obtain more accurate sentiment information. However, incorporating external knowledge into sentiment analysis to enhance information complementarity has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this, we propose a multichannel cross-modal feedback interaction model that incorporates the knowledge graph into multimodal sentiment analysis. Our proposed model consists of two main components: the cross-modal feedback recurrent interaction module and the external knowledge module for capturing latent information. The cross-modal interaction employs a self-feedback mechanism during network training, extracting feature representations of each modality and using these representations to mask sensory inputs, allowing the model to perform feedback-based feature masking. The external knowledge graph captures potential semantic information representations in the textual data through knowledge graph embedding. Finally, a global feature fusion module is employed for multichannel multimodal information integration.

Most existing techniques are limited to a single domain (e.g., medicine or politics) to identify fake news. However, many differences exist commonly across domains, such as word usage, which lead to those methods performing poorly in other domains. In the real world, social media releases millions of news pieces in diverse domains every day. Therefore, it is of significant practical importance to propose a fake news detection model that can be applied to multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on knowledge graphs (KG) for multi-domain fake news detection, named KG-MFEND. The model’s performance is enhanced by improving the BERT and integrating external knowledge to alleviate domain differences at the word level. Specifically, we construct a new KG that encompasses multi-domain knowledge and injects entity triples to build a sentence tree to enrich the news background knowledge. To solve the problem of embedding space and knowledge noise, we use the soft position and visible matrix in knowledge embedding. To reduce the influence of label noise, we add label smoothing to the training. Extensive experiments are conducted on real Chinese datasets.

To enable robots to effectively execute tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with multi-modal inputs in navigation is necessary. While LLMs offer rich semantic knowledge, they lack specific real-world information and real-time interaction capabilities. This paper introduces a Multi-modal Scene Graph (MMSG) navigation framework that aligns LLMs with visual perception models to predict next steps. Firstly, a multi-modal scene dataset is constructed, containing triplets of object-relations-target words. We provide target words and lists of existing objects in the scene to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding action plans for GPT-3.5. The generated data is then utilized for pre-train LLM for path planning. During inference, we discover objects in the scene by extending the DETR visual object detector to multi-view RGB image collected from different reachable positions. Experimental results show that path planning generated from MMSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, indicating its feasibility in complex environments. We evaluate our methods on the ProTHOR dataset and show superior navigation performance. © The Author(s) 2024.",Knowledge graph; Large language model; Task planning; Visual navigation,Knowledge graph; Machine vision; Motion planning; Navigation charts; Robot programming; Vision; Visual languages; Visual servoing; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Multi-modal; Scene-graphs; Semantics knowledge; Target words; Task planning; Visual Navigation; Visual perception; Semantics,FALSE

Our approach is based on the intuition that is the basis of neuro-symbolic AI systems: to combine deep learning and symbolic reasoning in one single model, in order to take the best out of both the paradigms. To this end, we start from a knowledge graph (KG) encoding information about users, ratings, and descriptive properties of the items and we design a model that combines background knowledge encoded in logical rules mined from the KG with explicit knowledge encoded in the triples of the KG itself to obtain a more precise representation of users and items. Specifically, our model is based on the combination of: (i) a rule learner that extracts first-order logic rules based on the information encoded in the knowledge graph; (ii) a graph embedding module, that jointly learns a vector space representation of users and items based on the triples encoded in the knowledge graph and the rules previously extracted; (iii) a recommendation module that uses the embeddings to feed a deep learning architecture that provides users with top-k recommendations. In the experimental section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on three datasets, and the results show that the combination of knowledge graph embeddings and first-order logic rules led to an improvement in the predictive accuracy and in the novelty of the recommendations.

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research and comparison of the performance of different PLMs in KGQA. To this end, we summarize two basic KGQA frameworks based on PLMs without additional neural network modules to compare the performance of nine PLMs in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Typically, techniques used to tackle such issues can be categorized into either of two groups: proactive and reactive approaches. This article introduces an approach combining both proactive and reactive solutions to remove illegal uploads on a platform while preventing legal uploads or modified versions of audio tracks, such as parodies, remixes or further types of edits. To achieve this, we have developed a rule-based focused crawler specifically designed to detect copyright infringement on audio files coupled with a visualization environment that maps the retrieved data on a knowledge graph to represent information extracted from audio files. Our system automatically scans multimedia files that are uploaded to a public collection when a user submits a search query, performing an audio information retrieval task only on files deemed legal. We present experimental results obtained from tests conducted by performing user queries on a large music collection, a subset of 25,000 songs and audio snippets obtained from the Free Music Archive library. The returned audio tracks have an associated Similarity Score, a metric we use to determine the quality of the adversarial searches executed by the system. We then proceed with discussing the effectiveness and efficiency of different settings of our proposed system.

When used to measure communication success, even the most granular affective model combined with sophisticated machine learning approaches may not fully capture an organisation’s strategic positioning goals. Such goals often deviate from the assumptions of standardised affective models. While certain emotions such as Joy and Trust typically represent desirable brand associations, specific communication goals formulated by marketing professionals often go beyond such standard dimensions. For instance, the brand manager of a television show may consider fear or sadness to be desired emotions for its audience. This article introduces expansion techniques for affective models, combining common and commonsense knowledge available in knowledge graphs with language models and affective reasoning, improving coverage and consistency as well as supporting domain-specific interpretations of emotions. An extensive evaluation compares the performance of different expansion techniques: (i) a quantitative evaluation based on the revisited Hourglass of Emotions model to assess performance on complex models that cover multiple affective categories, using manually compiled gold standard data, and (ii) a qualitative evaluation of a domain-specific affective model for television programme brands. The results of these evaluations demonstrate that the introduced techniques support a variety of embeddings and pre-trained models. The paper concludes with a discussion on applying this approach to other scenarios where affective model resources are scarce. © 2021, The Author(s).",Affective models; Embeddings; Hourglass of emotions; Knowledge graphs; Language models,Knowledge representation; Automatic expansion; Commonsense knowledge; Marketing professionals; Negative sentiments; Qualitative evaluations; Quantitative evaluation; Sophisticated machines; Strategic positioning; Expansion,FALSE

In fact, this form of assessment makes it viable to recognize new information on social users which incorporates emotions. In order to recognize users’ emotions and other latent attributes, most of the existing approaches have used textual data and have obtained accurate results. However, little attention has been paid to visual data that have become increasingly popular in recent years.This work describes how to develop a conceptual representation model for social network analysis and social emotion analysis based on the integration of fuzzy logic and ontological modeling. The primary aim is to create an ontology that can extract new information about a social user’s mood, which can be classified as panic, no-panic, or neutral. Fuzzy logic is necessary to deal with subjective data, as users share imprecise and vague data on their social profiles. Fuzzy logic has been observed as a successful method to capture the expression of emotions due to the fuzzy nature of emotions and the ambiguous definitions of emotion words. The proposed work investigate the role of fuzzy logic in social network analysis. This study simulate a fuzzy deep system integrated with ontology for classifying social visual data (shared images) into panic, no-panic or neutral classes in order to determine the social users’ stress intensity. The Social distancing and the huge amount of shared data in Tunisia were calculated to demonstrate this classification. The experiments performed in this paper aim to create not only a novel annotated visual database named visual panic database, but also a new semantic model for modeling users’ profiles, in social network, based on the combination between ontology and deep learning techniques. In this context, we will work in the future on the combination between a user’s visual and textual data in order to improve the performance of this recognition.

As context can be obtained from multiple sources, we explore two modalities of ContextNets: one based on multitask learning and another one based on knowledge graphs. Once the contextual information is obtained, we use it to enhance visual representations computed with a neural network. In this way, we are able to (1) capture information about the content and the style with the visual representations and (2) encode relationships between different artistic attributes with the ContextNet. We evaluate our models on both painting classification and retrieval, and by visualising the resulting embeddings on a knowledge graph, we can confirm that our models represent specific stylistic aspects present in the data. © 2019, The Author(s).",Art classification; Knowledge graphs; Multi-modal retrieval; Multitask learning; Visualisation,,FALSE

It is devised with a novel structure that combined GCN (Kipf and Welling in International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017) and LSTM (Hochreiter and chmidhuber in Neural Comput 9 (8): 1735-1780, 1997. https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735) which enables it to leverage knowledge graph data and historical predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the impressive task planning success rate of (Formula presented.), surpassing the best baseline method significantly, which achieves (Formula presented.). Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of multi-task manipulation across a specific set of 20 tasks within a simulated environment. Notably, RGCN combined with pre-trained primitive tasks exhibits the highest success rate compared with state-of-art multi-task learning methods. Our method is proven to be significant for language-conditioned task planning and is qualified for instructing robots for multi-task manipulation. © The Author(s) 2023.",Deep learning; Knowledge graph; Robot multi-task manipulation; Task planning,,FALSE

It also remains unknown under what circumstances or to what extent visual context is truly helpful to the task. In this work, we propose to learn entity representations from graph structures and visual context, and combine feature similarities to find alignments at the output level.

Existing computational methods mainly extract data from multiple resources and treat it as binary classification. However, this cannot unambiguously tell the boundary between positive and negative samples owing to the incompleteness and uncertainty of derived data. A granular computing method called three-way decision is proved to be effective in making uncertain decision, but it relies on supplementary information to make delay decision. Recently, biomedical knowledge graph has been regarded as an important source to obtain abundant supplementary information about drugs. This paper proposes a three-way decision-based method called 3WDDI, in combination with knowledge graph embedding as supplementary features to enhance DDI prediction. The drug pairs are divided into positive, negative and boundary regions by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) according to drug chemical structure feature. Further, delay decision is made for objects in the boundary region by integrating knowledge graph embedding feature to promote the accuracy of decision-making. The empirical results show that 3WDDI yields up to 0.8922, 0.9614, 0.9582, 0.8930 for Accuracy, AUPR, AUC and F1-score, respectively, and outperforms several baseline models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Convolutional neural network; Drug–drug interactions; Knowledge graph; Three-way decision,Clinical research; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Drug interactions; Forecasting; Graph embeddings; Graph neural networks; Boundary regions; Convolutional neural network; Decision graphs; Drug-drug interactions; Graph embeddings; Interaction prediction; Knowledge graphs; Pharmaceutical research; Supplementary information; Three-way decision; Knowledge graph,FALSE

One reason that MEL has not been solved is due to a problem that occurs in language where ambiguous texts can be resolved to several named entities. This problem is exacerbated when processing the text found in electronic health records. Recent work has shown that deep learning models based on transformers outperform previous methods on linking at higher rates of performance. We introduce NeighBERT, a custom pre-training technique which extends BERT (Devlin et al [1]) by encoding how entities are related within a knowledge graph. This technique adds relational context that has been traditionally missing in original BERT, helping resolve the ambiguity found in clinical text.

Among these methods, neighborhood-based methods are the mainstream methods. However, these methods ignore some meta-information about the items, specifically, the diversity of item information (e.g., texts) and feature interaction between neighboring nodes. In this paper, we propose a Bilinear Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Network Fusing Text Information (BKGNN-TI), which can model both knowledge graph information and text information. In particular, the information in knowledge graph contains not only the existing high-order connectivity but also feature interactions between neighboring nodes at the same level in KG. First, we construct the information propagation layer using the bilinear collector and linear collector. Feature interactions between neighboring nodes and the high-order connectivity are collected in the information propagation layer to generate the item knowledge representations. The bilinear collector emphasizes the importance of second-order feature interaction between neighboring nodes in the KG. Then, texts are also introduced when computing the item representations, which can help further infer user interests. We choose objective program titles and introductions as text information to avoid the influence of subjective factors. BKGNN-TI designs an ALBERT-based sequence encoder to encode texts by the structure of ALBERT+Bi-LSTM+Attention, thus enriching the feature representations of the items. In the experiments, we utilize two language datasets, i.e., the English public dataset Movielens-20M and the Chinese dataset IPTV constructed by ourselves.

Natural language processing (NLP) has created new possibilities for automating this upkeep by facilitating information extraction from free text. However, due to annotated and labeled biomedical data limitations, the development of completely autonomous information extraction systems remains a substantial scientific and technological hurdle. This study aims to explore methodologies best suited to support the automatic extraction of causal relationships from biomedical literature with the aim of regular and rapid updating of disease-specific pathophysiology mechanism KGs. Methods: Our proposed approach first searches and retrieves PubMed abstracts using the desired terms and keywords. The extension corpora are then passed through the NLP pipeline for automatic information extraction. We then identify triples representing cause-and-effect relationships and encode this content using the Biological Expression Language (BEL). Finally, domain experts perform an analysis of the completeness, relevance, accuracy, and novelty of the extracted triples. Results: In our test scenario, which is focused on the KG regarding the phosphorylation of the Tau protein, our pipeline successfully contributed novel data, which was then subsequently used to update the KG leading to the identification of six additional upstream regulators of Tau phosphorylation.

KGs have been successfully employed in challenging biomedical areas such as the identification of pathophysiology mechanisms or drug repurposing. The creation of high-quality KGs typically requires labor-intensive multi-database integration or substantial human expert curation, both of which take time and contribute to the workload of data processing and annotation. Therefore, the use of automatic systems for KG building and maintenance is a prerequisite for the wide uptake and utilization of KGs. Technologies supporting the automated generation and updating of KGs typically make use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is optimized for extracting implicit triples described in relevant biomedical text sources. At the core of this challenge is how to improve the accuracy and coverage of the information extraction module by utilizing different models and tools. The emergence of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT which has grown in popularity dramatically, has revolutionized the field of NLP, making them a potential candidate to be used in text-based graph creation as well. So far, no previous work has investigated the power of LLMs on the generation of cause-and-effect networks and KGs encoded in Biological Expression Language (BEL).

Accurate diagnosis of RDs is challenging, and there is a severe lack of drugs available for treatment. Pharmaceutical companies have shown a preference for drug repurposing from existing drugs developed for other diseases due to the high investment, high risk, and long cycle involved in RD drug development. Compared to traditional approaches, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) based methods are more efficient and convenient, as they treat drug repurposing as a link prediction task. KGE models allow for the enrichment of existing knowledge by incorporating multimodal information from various sources. In this study, we constructed RDKG-115, a rare disease knowledge graph involving 115 RDs, composed of 35,643 entities, 25 relations, and 5,539,839 refined triplets, based on 372,384 high-quality literature and 4 biomedical datasets: DRKG, Pathway Commons, PharmKG, and PMapp. Subsequently, we developed a trimodal KGE model containing structure, category, and description embeddings using reverse-hyperplane projection. We utilized this model to infer 4199 reliable new inferred triplets from RDKG-115. Finally, we calculated potential drugs and small molecules for each of the 115 RDs, taking multiple sclerosis as a case study.

The recognition task includes six entity types: “syndrome”, “symptom”, “etiology and pathogenesis”, “treatment method”, “medication”, and “prescription”. Methods: We annotated data in a BIO (B-begin, I-inside, O-outside) manner. For the characteristics of medical case texts, we proposed a custom dictionary method that can be dynamically updated for word segmentation. To compare the effect of the method on the experimental results, we applied the method in the BiLSTM-CRF model and IDCNN-CRF model, respectively. Results: The models using custom dictionaries (BiLSTM-CRF-Loaded and IDCNN-CRF-Loaded) outperformed the models without custom dictionaries (BiLSTM-CRF and IDCNN-CRF) in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The BiLSTM-CRF-Loaded model yielded F1 scores of 92.59% and 93.23% on the test set and validation set, respectively, surpassing the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model by 3.59% and 4.87%. Furthermore, when analyzing the results for the six entity categories separately, we found that the use of custom dictionaries has a marked impact, with the categories of “etiology and pathogenesis” and “syndrome” demonstrating the most noticeable improvements. By comparing the F1 scores, we observed that the entity category “medication” yielded the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of 96.04% and 96.48% on the test set and validation set, respectively. Conclusion: We propose a word segmentation method based on a dynamically updated custom dictionary. The method is combined with the BILSTM-CRF and the IDCNN-CRF models, which enhances the model to recognize domain-specific terms and new entities. It can be widely applied in dealing with complex text structures and texts containing domain-specific terms. © 2023 The Author(s)",BERT-BiLSTM-CRF; BiLSTM-CRF; Chest discomfort; IDCNN-CRF; Named entity recognition; TCM medical cases,"Chest Pain; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Natural Language Processing; Computational linguistics; Medicine; BERT-BiLSTM-CRF; BiLSTM-CRF; Chest discomfort; F1 scores; IDCNN-CRF; Medical case; Named entity recognition; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Traditional chinese medicine medical case; Word segmentation; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; Chinese medicine; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data processing; extraction; human; knowledge; language; natural language processing; performance; prescription; recall; recognition; thorax pain; vocabulary; thorax pain; Knowledge graph",FALSE

It can also assist businesses in making data-driven decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer service. However, as social media information continues to grow exponentially, and industry demands increase, sentiment analysis should no longer be limited to fundamental polarity classification of positive, neutral, and negative. Instead, it should move to more precise classification of emotions. Therefore, in this paper, we expand sentiment analysis to analysis of eight different emotions based on Plutchik's wheel of emotions, and define it as a multi-label classification task to identify complex and mixed emotions in text. We achieved an overall precision of 0.7958 for the eight emotions multi-label classification based on the attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory with convolution layer (AC-BiLSTM) model on the SemEval-2018 dataset. In addition, we proposed the introduction of the NRC emotion lexicon and emotion correlation constraints to optimise the emotion classification results. This ultimately increased the overall precision to 0.8228 demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we store and visualise the emotion analysis results in a graph structure, in order to achieve deductibility and traceability of emotions. © 2023",Emotion analysis; Knowledge graph; Multi-label classification; Sentiment analysis,Classification (of information); Graphic methods; Marketing; Social networking (online); Customer-service; Data driven decision; Emotion analysis; Emotion extractions; Knowledge graphs; Marketing strategy; Multi-label classifications; Sentiment analysis; Social media; User need; Sentiment analysis,FALSE

For this reason, the proposal of methods for the estimation of the degree of similarity and relatedness between words and concepts has been a very active line of research in the fields of artificial intelligence, information retrieval and natural language processing among others. Main approaches proposed in the literature can be categorised in two large families as follows: (1) Ontology-based semantic similarity Measures (OM) and (2) distributional measures whose most recent and successful methods are based on Word Embedding (WE) models. However, the lack of a deep analysis of both families of methods slows down the advance of this line of research and its applications. This work introduces the largest, reproducible and detailed experimental survey of OM measures and WE models reported in the literature which is based on the evaluation of both families of methods on a same software platform, with the aim of elucidating what is the state of the problem. We show that WE models which combine distributional and ontology-based information get the best results, and in addition, we show for the first time that a simple average of two best performing WE models with other ontology-based measures or WE models is able to improve the state of the art by a large margin.

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tools, based on sensors installed in smart homes, will become an important tool to provide useful information to the caregiver when something happens in the house of an elderly and care is required. The current available detection tools either exist out of interpretable knowledge-driven techniques or scalable data-driven ones. In this paper, a hybrid methodology that combines both approaches is designed and evaluated to Track Activities by Linking Knowledge (TALK). Both sensor data and their link to the relevant domain knowledge about where those sensors are installed, the performed activities that occur, and how the household is constructed, are generalized in a specific knowledge graph (KG) structure to represent continuous events. The interpretable knowledge graph embedding technique Instance Neighboring using Knowledge (INK) is then used to transform these events inside the KG to a tabular format, which can be used by any traditional machine learning classifier to create a HAR tool. The TALK methodology is evaluated on two HAR datasets and shows (a) that TALK outperforms both traditional automated data-driven as well as knowledge-driven techniques in terms of predictive performance, and (b) how TALK can be easily used in a more out of lab environment. All these results and the interpretable aspects show that TALK can become an important tool to monitor elderly in their homes efficiently, effectively and with less intrusive techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Ambient living; eHealth; Human Activity Recognition (HAR); Hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI); Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding; Smart monitoring,Automation; Domain Knowledge; Graph embeddings; Intelligent buildings; Pattern recognition; Ambient living; Ambients; Ehealth; Graph embeddings; Human activity recognition; Hybrid artificial intelligence; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Knowledge graph  embedding; Knowledge graphs; Smart monitoring; Knowledge graph,FALSE

In Life Sciences, numerous ontologies have been introduced to represent human knowledge, often providing overlapping or conflicting perspectives. These ontologies are usually published as OWL or OBO, and are often registered in open repositories, e.g., BioPortal. However, the task of finding the concepts (classes and their properties) defined in the existing ontologies and the relationships between these concepts across different ontologies – for example, for developing a new ontology aligned with the existing ones – requires a great deal of manual effort in searching through the public repositories for candidate ontologies and their entities. In this work, we develop a new tool, KNIT, to automatically explore open repositories to help users fetch the previously designed concepts using keywords. User-specified keywords are then used to retrieve matching names of classes or properties. KNIT then creates a draft knowledge graph populated with the concepts and relationships retrieved from the existing ontologies. Furthermore, following the process of ontology learning, our tool refines this first draft of an ontology. We present three BioPortal-specific use cases for our tool. These use cases outline the development of new knowledge graphs and ontologies in the sub-domains of biology: genes and diseases, virome and drugs. © 2023 The Author(s)",Knowledge graphs; Life sciences; Ontology; Ontology learning,Knowledge graph; Reusability; Concept class; Graph exploration; Human knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-representation; Life-sciences; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Open repositories; Property; Ontology,FALSE

This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system.

Several computational strategies have been suggested to estimate the risk of adverse drug events in preclinical drug development. While these approaches have demonstrated high utility in practice, they are at the same time limited to specific information sources. Thus, many current computational approaches neglect a wealth of information which results from the integration of different data sources, such as biological protein function, gene expression, chemical compound structure, cell-based imaging and others. In this work we propose an integrative and explainable multi-modal Graph Machine Learning approach (MultiGML), which fuses knowledge graphs with multiple further data modalities to predict drug related adverse events and general drug target-phenotype associations. MultiGML demonstrates excellent prediction performance compared to alternative algorithms, including various traditional knowledge graph embedding techniques. MultiGML distinguishes itself from alternative techniques by providing in-depth explanations of model predictions, which point towards biological mechanisms associated with predictions of an adverse drug event. Hence, MultiGML could be a versatile tool to support decision making in preclinical drug development. © 2023",Adverse event; Graph attention network; Graph convolutional network; Graph neural network; Knowledge graph; Machine learning,,FALSE

These expressions are successfully modeled with fuzzy technology, but they are not usually integrated yet with Natural Language Processing models and techniques. Large-scale pre-trained language models yield excellent results in many language tasks, but they have some drawbacks such as their lack of transparency and thorough temporal reasoning capabilities. Therefore, the use of such models may provoke inconsistent or incorrect dialogues in the context of conversational agents which were aimed at providing users of intelligent systems with interactive explanations. In this paper, we propose a model for fuzzy temporal reasoning to overcome some inconsistencies detected in pre-trained language models in a specific application domain of a conversational agent carefully designed for providing users with explanations which are endowed with a good balance between naturalness and fidelity. More precisely, starting from a knowledge graph that provides an intuitive representation of the entities and relations in the application domain, we describe how to map the temporal information onto a fuzzy temporal constraint network. This formalism allows to represent imprecise temporal information and provides mechanisms for checking consistency in conversations. In addition, as a proof of concept, we have developed TimeVersa, a conversational agent which integrates the proposed model into an application domain (i.e., a virtual assistant for tourists) that requires handling imprecise temporal constraints. We illustrate in a use case how the agent can identify temporal inconsistencies and answer queries related to temporal information properly. Results after a user study report that users' perception of consistency is significantly higher in a conversation with TimeVersa than in a similar conversation using the well-known GPT-3 Large Language Model, when vague temporal information is involved. The proposed approach is a step forward for developing conversational agents operating in application domains that require temporal reasoning under uncertainty. © 2024 The Author(s)",Conversational agents; Fuzzy temporal constraint networks; Fuzzy temporal reasoning; Knowledge graphs; Language models,Computational linguistics; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Applications domains; Conversational agents; Effective communication; Fuzzy technology; Fuzzy temporal constraint networks; Fuzzy temporal reasoning; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Temporal information; Temporal reasoning; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Therefore, multi-faceted conceptual modelling is often conducted based on multi-sourced data covering indispensable aspects, and information fusion is frequently applied to cope with the high dimensionality and data heterogeneity. The consideration of intra-facets relationships is also indispensable. In this context, a knowledge graph (KG), which can aggregate the relationships of multiple aspects by semantic associations, was exploited to facilitate the multi-faceted conceptual modelling based on heterogeneous and semantic-rich data. Firstly, rules of fault mechanism are extracted from the existing domain knowledge repository, and node attributes are extracted from multi-sourced data. Through abstraction and tokenisation of existing knowledge repository and concept-centric data, rules of fault mechanism were symbolised and integrated with the node attributes, which served as the entities for the concept-centric knowledge graph (CKG). Subsequently, the transformation of process data to a stack of temporal graphs was conducted under the CKG backbone. Lastly, the graph convolutional network (GCN) model was applied to extract temporal and attribute correlation features from the graphs, and a temporal convolution network (TCN) was built for conceptual modelling using these features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the close synergy between the KG-supported approach and multi-faceted conceptual modelling is demonstrated and substantiated in a case study using real-world data. © 2023 The Author(s)",Information integration; Knowledge graph-supported data fusion; Multi-faceted modelling,Behavioral research; Convolution; Data mining; Domain Knowledge; Information fusion; Knowledge graph; Metadata; Product design; Semantics; Conceptual model; Data-source; Driving behaviour; Fault mechanism; Information integration; Knowledge graph-supported data fusion; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge repository; Multi-faceted modeling; Node attribute; Data fusion,FALSE

Unlike previous research, which often relies on limited datasets and classic methodologies, we leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Twitter data through advanced models of entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and community extraction, having persistence in Knowledge Graphs for consuming the intelligence efficiently. Results indicate that in the US midterm elections 2022, Arizona was the state that provided more content (507,551 tweets) related to a Chief Electoral Official, with 31.58% of them identified in the most aggressive cluster due to its mean attribute values of “attack on commenter” (0.7), “inflammatory” (∼0.3), “attack on author” (∼0.2), and “toxicity” (∼0.2). The name entity recognition model also identified an association between those aggressive tweets and the previous 2020 US Presidential campaign, characterized by attacks on election officials based on conspiracy theories campaigns. Knowledge graphs contributed to understanding the concentration of attacks and connectivity between topics commonly mentioned in hate speech content. Thus, our results offer detailed insights into the actors and dynamics of online harassment in electoral contexts, illuminating the challenges posed by harassment and proposing preventive mechanisms applicable to diverse electoral processes worldwide. © 2024 The Author(s)",Cyber democracy; Harassment; NER; NLP; Semantic similarity; Sentiment analysis; US midterm elections,Knowledge graph; Semantics; Social networking (online); Cybe democracy; Harassment; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; NER; Semantic similarity; Sentiment analysis; Social media; US midterm election; Sentiment analysis,FALSE

In order to deal with this issue, several temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) approaches have been proposed to integrate temporal and structural information. However, these methods only employ a uniformly random sampling to construct negative facts. As a consequence, the corrupted samples are often too simplistic for training an effective model. In this paper, we propose a new temporal knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial learning to further refine the performance of traditional TKGE models. In our framework, a generator is utilized to construct high-quality plausible quadruples and a discriminator learns to obtain the embeddings of entities and relations based on both positive and negative samples. Meanwhile, we also apply a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein distance to prevent vanishing gradient problems on discrete data; an inherent flaw in traditional generative adversarial networks. Through comprehensive experimentation on temporal datasets, the results indicate that our proposed framework can attain significant improvements based on benchmark models and also demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our framework. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Generative adversarial networks; Gumbel-Softmax relaxation; Temporal knowledge graph embedding; Wasserstein distance,Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Active field; Adversarial learning; Graph embeddings; Gumbel-softmax relaxation; Knowledge graphs; Structural data; Temporal knowledge; Temporal knowledge graph embedding; Temporal variation; Wasserstein distance; Generative adversarial networks,FALSE

However, existing fake news detection methods exaggerate the influence of public opinions, making it challenging to combat misinformation since its early spreading state. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel fake news detection framework through news semantic environment perception (NSEP) to identify fake news content. The NSEP framework consists of three major steps. First, NSEP divides the news semantic environment with time-constrained intervals into macro and micro semantic environments using an in-depth distinguisher module. Second, graph convolutional networks are applied to perceive the semantic inconsistencies between intrinsic news content and extrinsic post tokens in the macro semantic environment. Third, a micro semantic detection module guided by multihead attention and sparse attention is utilized to capture the semantic contradictions between news content and posts in the micro semantic environment, providing explicit evidence for determining the authenticity of fake news candidates. Empirical experiments conducted on real-world Chinese and English datasets show that the NSEP framework on Chinese datasets achieved as high as 86.8% accuracy, performing at most 14.1% higher accuracy than that of other state-of-the-art baseline methods and confirming that detecting news content through both micro and macro semantic environments is an effective methodology for alleviating early propagation of fake news.

Researchers started using AI for drug discovery. Predicting the Adverse Drug Reactions(ADRs) caused by the drug in the manufacturing stage or in the clinical trial stage is a very important problem in drug discovery. ADRs have become a major concern resulting in injuries and also becoming fatal sometimes. Drug safety has gained much importance over the years propelling to the forefront investigation of predicting the ADRs. Although prior studies have queried diverse approaches to predict ADRs, very few were found to be effective. Also, the problem of having fewer reports makes the prediction of ADRs more difficult. To tackle this problem effectively, a novel method has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method is based on Knowledge Graph(KG) embedding. Using the KG embedding, we designed and trained a custom-made Deep Neural Network(DNN) called KGDNN(Knowledge Graph DNN) for predicting the ADRs. A KG has been constructed with 6 types of entities: drugs, ADRs, target proteins, indications, pathways, and genes. Using the Node2Vec algorithm, each node has been embedded into a feature space. Using those embeddings, the ADRs are classified by the KGDNN model. The proposed method has obtained an AUROC score of 0.917 and significantly outperformed the existing methods.

A key barrier to such integrative analyses is the lack of semantic interoperability across different institutions due to coding differences. We propose a Multiview Incomplete Knowledge Graph Integration (MIKGI) algorithm to integrate information from multiple sources with partially overlapping EHR concept codes to enable translations between healthcare systems. Methods: The MIKGI algorithm combines knowledge graph information from (i) embeddings trained from the co-occurrence patterns of medical codes within each EHR system and (ii) semantic embeddings of the textual strings of all medical codes obtained from the Self-Aligning Pretrained BERT (SAPBERT) algorithm. Due to the heterogeneity in the coding across healthcare systems, each EHR source provides partial coverage of the available codes. MIKGI synthesizes the incomplete knowledge graphs derived from these multi-source embeddings by minimizing a spherical loss function that combines the pairwise directional similarities of embeddings computed from all available sources. MIKGI outputs harmonized semantic embedding vectors for all EHR codes, which improves the quality of the embeddings and enables direct assessment of both similarity and relatedness between any pair of codes from multiple healthcare systems. Results: With EHR co-occurrence data from Veteran Affairs (VA) healthcare and Mass General Brigham (MGB), MIKGI algorithm produces high quality embeddings for a variety of downstream tasks including detecting known similar or related entity pairs and mapping VA local codes to the relevant EHR codes used at MGB. Based on the cosine similarity of the MIKGI trained embeddings, the AUC was 0.918 for detecting similar entity pairs and 0.809 for detecting related pairs. For cross-institutional medical code mapping, the top 1 and top 5 accuracy were 91.0% and 97.5% when mapping medication codes at VA to RxNorm medication codes at MGB; 59.1% and 75.8% when mapping VA local laboratory codes to LOINC hierarchy. When trained with 500 labels, the lab code mapping attained top 1 and 5 accuracy at 77.7% and 87.9%. MIKGI also attained best performance in selecting VA local lab codes for desired laboratory tests and COVID-19 related features for COVID EHR studies. Compared to existing methods, MIKGI attained the most robust performance with accuracy the highest or near the highest across all tasks. Conclusions: The proposed MIKGI algorithm can effectively integrate incomplete summary data from biomedical text and EHR data to generate harmonized embeddings for EHR codes for knowledge graph modeling and cross-institutional translation of EHR codes. © 2022",Code mapping; Knowledge graph; PMI matrix; Transfer learning; Word embedding,"Algorithms; COVID-19; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Codes (symbols); Data integration; Electronic data interchange; Embeddings; Health care; Integration; Knowledge graph; Medical imaging; Medical information systems; Semantics; Code mapping; Electronic health; Embeddings; Health records; Incomplete knowledge; Knowledge graphs; matrix; PMI matrix; Transfer learning; Word embedding; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; data accuracy; data base; data integration; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic medical record; health care system; human; laboratory test; leukocyte; mass general brigham; mathematical model; microscopy; multiview Incomplete knowledge graph Integration; self aligning pretrained BERT; sensitivity and specificity; synthesis; thrombocyte; transfer of learning; urine sampling; validation process; automated pattern recognition; electronic health record; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; Mapping",FALSE

The suffering of patients may have multiple subtypes with certain similarities and differences, which need to be addressed for learning effective patient representation to facilitate the downstream tasks.

To alleviate this problem, we studied how to effectively integrate data from all disease subtypes to improve the representation of each subtype. Specifically, we proposed a knowledge-aware shared-private neural network model to explicitly use disease-oriented knowledge and learn shared and specific representations from the disease and its subtype perspectives.

Relations between disease concepts are often distributed across multiple datasets, including unstructured plain text datasets and incomplete disease knowledge graphs. Extracting disease relations from multimodal data sources is thus crucial for constructing accurate and comprehensive disease knowledge graphs. We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation extraction. The REMAP machine learning approach jointly embeds a partial, incomplete knowledge graph and a medical language dataset into a compact latent vector space, aligning the multimodal embeddings for optimal disease relation extraction. Additionally, REMAP utilizes a decoupled model structure to enable inference in single-modal data, which can be applied under missing modality scenarios. We apply the REMAP approach to a disease knowledge graph with 96,913 relations and a text dataset of 1.24 million sentences. On a dataset annotated by human experts, REMAP improves language-based disease relation extraction by 10.0% (accuracy) and 17.2% (F1-score) by fusing disease knowledge graphs with language information. Furthermore, REMAP leverages text information to recommend new relationships in the knowledge graph, outperforming graph-based methods by 8.4% (accuracy) and 10.4% (F1-score). REMAP is a flexible multimodal approach for extracting disease relations by fusing structured knowledge and language information.

To address this limitation, this article describes the development of GENA - (Graph of mEntal-health and Nutrition Association), a knowledge graph that represents relations between nutrition and mental health, extracted from biomedical abstracts. GENA is constructed from PubMed abstracts that contain keywords relating to chemicals, food, and health. A hybrid named entity recognition (NER) model is firstly applied to these abstracts to identify various entities of interest. Subsequently, a deep syntax-based relation extraction model is used to detect binary relations between the identified entities. Finally, the resulting relations are used to populate the GENA knowledge graph, whose relationships can be accessed in an intuitive and interpretable manner using the Neo4J Database Management System. To evaluate the reliability of GENA, two annotators manually assessed a subset of the extracted relations. The evaluation results show that our methods obtain high precision for the NER task and acceptable precision and relative recall for the relation extraction task. GENA consists of 43,367 relationships that encode information about nutrition and health, of which 94.04% are new relations that are not present in existing ontologies of food and diseases. GENA is constructed based on scientific principles, and has the potential to be used within further applications to contribute towards scientific research within the domain.

The modern warfare approach has also evolved from the traditional physical domain to the cognitive domain, and competing for advantages in the cognitive domain has become a key objective of combat. Therefore, constructing domain knowledge graphs and mining the relationships between data play an important role in cognitive domain analysis. In this paper, we propose a convolutional network recognition method based on improved two-layer bi-directional BiLSTM networks named the BERT-α BiLSTMs-RECNN-CRF (BDBRC) model. For the difficulties of military entities generally having long names and low extraction accuracy, as well as the existence of a large number of composite entities that are difficult to recognize, an improved two-layer BiLSTM model is devised first. In view of the fact that the BiLSTMs model always extracts features equally in long-distance text sequences without actually considering the different influences of different sentence contexts, contribution factor a is added to extract the contribution of the above and below to the target entity in different sentences respectively. Then, aiming at the strong problem of the domain of military news texts and the high level of inter-entity ambiguity, we propose a method that utilizes a modified convolutional network (RECNN) for partial feature extraction and jointly with a modified two-layer BiLSTM network for entity recognition. The experiment on the self-constructed dataset shows that the F1 value of the model proposed in this paper reaches 93.18%, and the F1 value, P, and H of our model are all better than the baseline model, which verifies the performance of the model.

This leads to biases in user interest and popularity. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel recommendation approach termed Knowledge-enhanced Perceptive Graph Attention with Graph Contrastive Learning (KPA-GCL), which leverages relational graph convolutional neural networks. The proposed method optimizes the triplet embedding representation of entity-item interactions based on relationships between adjacent entities in a heterogeneous graph. Subsequently, a graph convolutional neural network is employed for enhanced aggregation. Similarity scores from a contrastive view serve as the selection criterion for high-quality embedded representations, facilitating the extraction of refined knowledge subgraphs. Multiple adaptive contrast-loss optimization functions are introduced by combining Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and hard negative sampling techniques. Comparative experiments are conducted with ten popular existing methods using real public datasets. Results indicate that the KPA-GCL method outperforms compared methods in all datasets based on Recall, NDCG, Precision, and Hit-ratio measures. Furthermore, in terms of mitigating cold start and noise, the KPA-GCL method surpasses other ten methods. This validates the reasonability and effectiveness of KPA-GCL in real-world datasets. © 2024 The Author(s)",Graph contrast learning; Graph convolutional neural network; Knowledge graph; Recommendation system,,FALSE

Consequently, many sources that include commonsense knowledge have been designed and constructed over the past decades. Recently, the focus has been on large text-based sources, which facilitate easier integration with neural (language) models and application to textual tasks, typically at the expense of the semantics of the sources and their harmonization. Efforts to consolidate commonsense knowledge have yielded partial success, with no clear path towards a comprehensive solution. We aim to organize these sources around a common set of dimensions of commonsense knowledge. We survey a wide range of popular commonsense sources with a special focus on their relations. We consolidate these relations into 13 knowledge dimensions. This consolidation allows us to unify the separate sources and to compute indications of their coverage, overlap, and gaps with respect to the knowledge dimensions. Moreover, we analyze the impact of each dimension on downstream reasoning tasks that require commonsense knowledge, observing that the temporal and desire/goal dimensions are very beneficial for reasoning on current downstream tasks, while distinctness and lexical knowledge have little impact.

This is because the branch of the machine learning field related to methodologies is enabling human understanding of the reasons for the outputs of recommender systems. The realization of explainable recommendation is widely expected to increase both user satisfaction and the demand for explainable recommendation systems. Explainable recommendation utilizes a wealth of side information (such as sellers, brands, user ages and genders, and bookmark information, among others) to expound the decision-making reasoning applied by recommendation models. In explainable recommendation, although learning side information containing numerous variables leads to rich interpretability, learning too many variables presents a challenge because decreases the amount of learning that a given computational resource can perform, and the accuracy of the recommendation model may be degraded. However, numerous and diverse variables are included in the side information stored by the actual companies operating massive real-world services. Hence, to realize practical applications of this valuable information, it is necessary to resolve problems such as computational cost. In this study, we propose a new framework for explainable recommendation based on an improved knowledge graph attention network model, which utilizes the side information of items and realizes high recommendation accuracy. The proposed framework enables direct interpretation by visualizing the reasons for the recommendations provided. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduced computational time requirements by approximately 80%, while maintaining recommendation accuracy by enabling the model to learn the probabilistically given edges included in the graph structure. Moreover, the results show that the proposed framework exhibited richer interpretability than the conventional model.

Among other benefits, these tools can foster a deeper understanding of fine arts, ultimately supporting the spread of culture. However, most of the systems proposed in the literature are only based on visual features of digitized artwork images, which are sometimes only integrated with some metadata and textual comments. A Knowledge Graph (KG) that integrates a rich body of information about artworks, artists, painting schools, etc., in a unified structured framework, can provide a valuable resource for more powerful information retrieval and knowledge discovery tools in the artistic domain. To this end, in this paper we present ArtGraph:1 an artistic KG based on WikiArt and DBpedia. The graph already provides knowledge discovery capabilities without having to train a learning system. In addition, we propose a novel KG-enabled fine art classification method based on ArtGraph, which is used to perform artwork attribute prediction tasks. The method extracts embeddings from ArtGraph and injects them as “contextual” knowledge into a Deep Learning model.

Yet, retrieving this information is not trivial since in a cooperative task it is hard to isolate the performance of an individual from the one of the whole team. Moreover, it is not always clear the relationship between the role of an agent and his personal attributes. In this work we conceive an application of the Shapley analysis for studying the contribution of both agent policies and attributes, putting them on equal footing. Since the computational complexity is NP-hard and scales exponentially with the number of participants in a transferable utility coalitional game, we resort to exploiting a-priori knowledge about the rules of the game to constrain the relations between the participants over a graph. We hence propose a method to determine a Hierarchical Knowledge Graph of agents’ policies and features in a Multi-Agent System. Assuming a simulator of the system is available, the graph structure allows to exploit dynamic programming to assess the importances in a much faster way. We test the proposed approach in a proof-of-case environment deploying both hardcoded policies and policies obtained via Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed paradigm is less computationally demanding than trivially computing the Shapley values and provides great insight not only into the importance of an agent in a team but also into the attributes needed to deploy the policy at its best. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",A-priori knowledge graphs; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Explainable Multi-Agent Systems; Myerson values; Shapley values,Decision making; Deep learning; Dynamic programming; Knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning; A-priori knowledge graph; Decision makers; Efficient computation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Explainable multi-agent system; Knowledge graphs; Myerson value; Priori knowledge; Quantitative assessments; Shapley value; Multi agent systems,FALSE

Existing approaches mainly formulate chest radiology report generation as an image captioning task and adopt the encoder-decoder framework. However, in the medical domain, such pure data-driven approaches suffer from the following problems: 1) visual and textual bias problem; 2) lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-enhanced radiology report generation approach introduces two types of medical knowledge: 1) General knowledge, which is input independent and provides the broad knowledge for report generation; 2) Specific knowledge, which is input dependent and provides the fine-grained knowledge for chest X-ray report generation. To fully utilize both the general and specific knowledge, we also propose a knowledge-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism. By merging the visual features of the radiology image with general knowledge and specific knowledge, the proposed model can improve the quality of generated reports. The experimental results on the publicly available IU-Xray dataset show that the proposed knowledge-enhanced approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in almost all metrics. And the results of MIMIC-CXR dataset show that the proposed knowledge-enhanced approach is on par with state-of-the-art methods.

They typically store patterns as a knowledge graph (KG), consisting of nodes (objects) and edges (relationships between objects). Given that most KGs are noisy and far from being complete, KG analysis and completion is required to establish the likely truth of new facts and correct unlikely ones based on the existing data within the KG. An effective way for tackling this, is through translation techniques which encode entities and links with hidden representations in embedding spaces. In this paper, we aim at improving the state-of-the-art translation techniques by taking into account the multiple facets of the different patterns and behaviors of each relation type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first latent representation model which considers relational representations to be dependent on the entities they relate. The multi-modality of the relation type over different entities is effectively formulated as a projection matrix over the space spanned by the entity vectors. We develop an economic computation of the projection matrix by directly providing an analytic formulation other than relying on a more consuming iterative optimization procedure. Two large benchmark knowledge bases are used to evaluate the performance with respect to the link prediction task. A new test data partition scheme is proposed to offer better understanding of the behavior of a link prediction model.

To this end, although existing entity alignment approaches could be adopted, they operate in the Euclidean space, and the resulting Euclidean entity representations can lead to large distortion of KG's hierarchical structure. Besides, the visual information has yet not been well exploited. In response to these issues, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal entity alignment approach, Hyperbolic multi-modal entity alignment (HMEA), which extends the Euclidean representation to hyperboloid manifold. We first adopt the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs) to learn structural representations of entities. Regarding the visual information, we generate image embeddings using the densenet model, which are also projected into the hyperbolic space using HGCNs. Finally, we combine the structure and visual representations in the hyperbolic space and use the aggregated embeddings to predict potential alignment results.

However, this approach is inefficient since it requires coupling a query with every record in the dataset and computing a forward pass for each sample at runtime, precluding scalability to large-scale datasets. We thus propose a solution that overcomes the above limitation by combining transformers and deep metric learning to create a latent space where texts and images are separately embedded, and their spatial proximity translates into semantic similarity.

Our study revealed that a bidirectional LLM, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), does not suffer from this issue. To investigate further, we focused on more complex deductive reasoning by training encoder and decoder LLMs to perform union and intersection operations on sets. While both types of models managed tasks involving two sets, they struggled with operations involving three sets.

The framework aims to enable collaborative data-driven sustainability optimization in urban logistics. It comprises ontologies to facilitate interoperability among stakeholders by providing a shared understanding of the exchanged data. The framework utilizes causal artificial intelligence to enable traceability and transparency of data-driven decisions compared to conventional machine learning working based on correlations.

In this position paper, we explore how Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can address these challenges by offering a structured and integrative approach to collecting and transforming audit traces.

The result is that the vectorization of the knowledge represented in the graph can be queried for missing knowledge of the trade by virtue of the various entities' proximity in the multidimensional embedding space. In this article, we build a knowledge graph about the antiquities trade using a semantic annotation tool, drawing on the series of articles in the Trafficking Culture Project's online encyclopedia. We then use the AmpliGraph package, a series of tools for supervised machine learning (Costabello et al. 2019) to turn the graph into a knowledge graph embedding model. We query the model to predict new hypotheses and to cluster actors in the trade. The model suggests connections between actors and institutions hitherto unsuspected and not otherwise present in the original knowledge graph. This approach could hold enormous potential for illuminating the hidden corners of the illicit antiquities trade. The same method could be applied to other kinds of archaeological knowledge.

Although retrospective studies attempt to operate various representations, it is a crucial step for an accurate prediction to aggregate these features and bring the associations between drugs and diseases into a unified latent space. In addition, the number of unknown associations between drugs and diseases, which is considered negative data, is much higher than the number of known associations, or positive data, leading to an imbalanced dataset. In this regard, we propose the DrugRep-KG method, which applies a knowledge graph embedding approach for representing drugs and diseases, to address these challenges. Despite the typical DR methods that consider all unknown drug-disease associations as negative data, we select a subset of unknown associations, provided the disease occurs because of an adverse reaction to a drug. DrugRep-KG has been evaluated based on different settings and achieves an AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 90.83% and an AUC-PR (area under the precision-recall curve) of 90.10%, which are higher than in previous works.

Many existing methods are purely data driven, focusing on exploiting the intrinsic topology and construction rules of molecules without any chemical prior information. The high data dependency makes them difficult to generalize to a wider chemical space and leads to a lack of interpretability of predictions. Here, to address this issue, we introduce a chemical element-oriented knowledge graph to summarize the basic knowledge of elements and their closely related functional groups. We further propose a method for knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompt (KANO), exploiting external fundamental domain knowledge in both pre-training and fine-tuning. Specifically, with element-oriented knowledge graph as a prior, we first design an element-guided graph augmentation in contrastive-based pre-training to explore microscopic atomic associations without violating molecular semantics. Then, we learn functional prompts in fine-tuning to evoke the downstream task-related knowledge acquired by the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that KANO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on 14 molecular property prediction datasets and provides chemically sound explanations for its predictions.

This paper presents new approaches to the system for ticketing ubiquity with blockchains (STUB), a novel smart transport ticketing solution that employs ontochains, a hybrid data structure combining blockchains and ontologies to form a type of distributed knowledge graph. STUB aims to address these limitations by providing a secure, transparent, and flexible platform for ticket issuance, validation, and management. We describe the key components and workflow of the STUB system, highlighting the use of transport network ontologies for modelling complex relationships within transportation systems and blockchain technologies for transport network ontology's state. Additionally, the implementation of Merkle proofs for efficient and secure validation between on-chain and off-chain ontological data is discussed. Finally, a simulated toy example is used as a lightweight proof-of-concept to demonstrate these capabilities.

To address the issue, an inference method based on Media Convergence and Rule-guided Joint Inference model (MCRJI) has been proposed. The authors not only converge multi-media features of entities but also introduce logic rules to improve the accuracy and interpretability of link prediction. First, a multi-headed self-attention approach is used to obtain the attention of different media features of entities during semantic synthesis. Second, logic rules of different lengths are mined from knowledge graph to learn new entity representations. Finally, knowledge graph inference is performed based on representing entities that converge multi-media features.

Because the manual annotations are difficult to obtain in real-world application, unsupervised cross-media hashing is studied to address the hashing learning without manual annotations. Existing unsupervised cross-media hashing methods generally focus on calculating the similarities through the features of multimedia data, while the learned hashing code cannot reflect the semantic relationship among the multimedia data, which hinders the accuracy in the cross-media retrieval. When humans try to understand multimedia data, the knowledge of concept relations in our brain plays an important role in obtaining high-level semantic. Inspired by this, we propose a knowledge guided unsupervised cross-media hashing (KGUCH) approach, which applies the knowledge graph to construct high-level semantic correlations for unsupervised cross-media hash learning. Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) The knowledge graph is introduced as auxiliary knowledge to construct the semantic graph for the concepts in each image and text instance, which can bridge the multimedia data with high-level semantic correlations to improve the accuracy of learned hash codes for cross-media retrieval. 2) The proposed KGUCH approach constructs correlation of the multimedia data from both the semantic and the feature aspects, which can exploit complementary information to promote the unsupervised cross-media hash learning.

The SCG module provides a high degree of flexibility for constructing segmentation networks that seamlessly make use of the benefits of variants of graph neural networks (GNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN).

In the approach, a comprehensive ontology is defined and then applied to construct a BID-specific knowledge graph, enabling efficient representation of the diverse and rich biological knowledge. The knowledge graph supports BID by facilitating knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Retrieval in BID is accomplished by finding potential links between biological systems and relevant design applications. Reasoning in BID is supported by a link prediction model that follows the design process of mapping from biological systems to design applications. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Through an in-depth structural analysis of this graph, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities along with their connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. We find that the graph has an inherently scale-free nature, shows a high level of connectedness, and can be used as a rich source for downstream graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties to reveal insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors.

One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky’s ‘Composition VII’ painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos and order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents.

It integrates multiple modalities to improve learning and generalization performance. However, most previous methods just focus on learning a common shared feature space for all modalities and ignore the private information hidden in each individual modality. To address this problem, we propose a novel shared-private information bottleneck (SPIB) method for cross-modal clustering. First, we devise a hybrid words model and a consensus clustering model to construct the shared information of multiple modalities, which capture the statistical correlation of low-level features and the semantic relations of the high-level clustering partitions, respectively. Second, the shared information of multiple modalities and the private information of individual modalities are maximally preserved through a unified information maximization function. Finally, the optimization of SPIB function is performed by a sequential 'draw-and-merge' procedure, which guarantees the function converges to a local maximum. Besides, to solve the lack of tags in cross-modal social images, we also investigate the use of structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graph to enrich the information in semantic modality and design a novel semantic similarity measurement for social images.

Considering the high uncertainty of answers for subjective tasks, in this paper, we propose a background knowledge enhanced quality estimation method. More specifically, first we learn the distributed knowledge representation from knowledge graphs and text corpora by utilizing the multi-task learning framework.

Aiming at this issue, we design a method that integrates image vision information and text information derived from Wikimedia Commons to construct a domain-specific multi-modal knowledge graph, taking the metallic materials domain as an example to illustrate the method.

In particular, modern model-based collaborative filtering algorithms, such as latent factor models, are considered state-of-the-art in recommendation systems. Unfortunately, these black box systems lack transparency, as they provide little information about the reasoning behind their predictions. White box systems, in contrast, can, by nature, easily generate explanations. However, their predictions are less accurate than sophisticated black box models. Recent research has demonstrated that explanations are an essential component in bringing the powerful predictions of big data and machine learning methods to a mass audience without compromising trust. Explanations can take a variety of formats, depending on the recommendation domain and the machine learning model used to make predictions. The objective of this work is to build a recommender system that can generate both accurate predictions and semantically rich explanations that justify the predictions. We propose a novel approach to build an explanation generation mechanism into a latent factor-based black box recommendation model. The designed model is trained to learn to make predictions that are accompanied by explanations that are automatically mined from the semantic web. Our evaluation experiments, which carefully study the trade-offs between the quality of predictions and explanations, show that our proposed approach succeeds in producing explainable predictions without a significant sacrifice in prediction accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; collaborative filtering; explanations; matrix factorization; recommender systems; semantic web,Collaborative filtering; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Knowledge representation; Machine learning; Online systems; Collaborative filtering algorithms; Evaluation experiments; Generation mechanism; Information overloads; Latent factor models; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Quality of predictions; Recommender systems,FALSE

First, a novel multimodal visual bayesian personalized ranking algorithm is proposed to fully utilize the cross-modal semantic correlations among different image features. Then, a new recommendation list called LA is generated accordingly from the multimodal perspective. Second, user preference is acquired using the hierarchical sampling statistics model. A new recommendation list called LH is generated in turn from the statistical perspective. Finally, hybrid recommendation results are obtained on the basis of LH and LA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid recommendation system for tourist spots is effective and robust. It is superior to other competitive baselines.

To generate human-like captions, we focus on captioning the images of news, which could provide real-world knowledge of the whole story behind the images. Then we propose a novel model that makes captions closer to the human-like description of the image, by leveraging the semantic relevance of the named entities. The named entities are not only extracted from news under the guidance of the image content, but also extended with external knowledge based on the semantic relations.

The wind energy sector is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy, yet turbines regularly suffer from failures and operational inconsistencies, leading to downtimes and significant maintenance costs. Addressing these issues requires rapid interpretation of complex and dynamic data patterns under time-critical conditions. In this article, we present a novel approach that leverages interactive, natural language-based decision support for operations & maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. The proposed interactive QA system allows engineers to pose domain-specific questions in natural language, and provides answers (in natural language) based on the automated retrieval of information on turbine sub-components, their properties and interactions, from a bespoke domain-specific knowledge graph. As data for specific faults is often sparse, we propose the use of paraphrase generation as a way to augment the existing dataset. Our QA system leverages encoder-decoder models to generate Cypher queries to obtain domain-specific facts from the KG database in response to user-posed natural language questions. Experiments with an attention-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model and a transformer show that the transformer accurately predicts up to 89.75% of responses to input questions, outperforming the Seq2Seq model marginally by 0.76%, though being 9.46 times more computationally efficient.

Given this wealth of information in social media, finding related announcements has become a relevant task, particularly in trending news (e.g., COVID-19 or lung cancer). To facilitate the search of connected posts, social networks enable users to annotate their posts, e.g., with hashtags in tweets. Albeit effective, an annotation-based search is limited because results will only include the posts that share the same annotations. This paper focuses on retrieving context-related posts based on a specific topic, and presents PINYON, a knowledge-driven framework, that retrieves associated posts effectively. PINYON implements a two-fold pipeline. First, it encodes, in a graph, a CORPUS of posts and an input post; posts are annotated with entities for existing knowledge graphs and connected based on the similarity of their entities. In a decoding phase, the encoded graph is used to discover communities of related posts. We cast this problem into the Vertex Coloring Problem, where communities of similar posts include the posts annotated with entities colored with the same colors. Built on results reported in the graph theory, PINYON implements the decoding phase guided by a heuristic-based method that determines relatedness among posts based on contextual knowledge, and efficiently groups the most similar posts in the same communities. PINYON is empirically evaluated on various datasets and compared with state-of-the-art implementations of the decoding phase. The quality of the generated communities is also analyzed based on multiple metrics. The observed outcomes indicate that PINYON accurately identifies semantically related posts in different contexts. Moreover, the reported results put in perspective the impact of known properties about the optimality of existing heuristics for vertex graph coloring and their implications on PINYON scalability.  © 2013 IEEE.",community detection; COVID-19; knowledge graph; knowledge retrieval; post relatedness; Social media networks,Decoding; Graph theory; Heuristic methods; Knowledge graph; Social networking (online); Background knowledge; Community detection; Context-Aware; Decoding phasis; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge retrieval; Post relatedness; Social media; Social media networks; Wealth of information; COVID-19,FALSE

Scene graph and knowledge graph (KG) construction technologies have attracted much attention for knowledge-based embodied question answering meeting this expectation. However, collecting and managing real data on daily activities under various experimental conditions in a physical space are quite costly, and developing AI that understands the intentions and contexts is difficult. In the future, data from both virtual spaces, where conditions can be easily modified, and physical spaces, where conditions are difficult to change, are expected to be combined to analyze daily living activities. However, studies on the KG construction of daily activities using virtual space and their application have yet to progress. The potential and challenges must still be clarified to facilitate AI development for human daily life. Thus, this study proposes the VirtualHome2KG framework to generate synthetic KGs of daily life activities in virtual space. This framework augments both the synthetic video data of daily activities and the contextual semantic data corresponding to the video contents based on the proposed event-centric schema and virtual space simulation results. Therefore, context-aware data can be analyzed, and various applications that have conventionally been difficult to develop due to the insufficient availability of relevant data and semantic information can be developed. We also demonstrate herein the utility and potential of the proposed VirtualHome2KG framework through several use cases, including the analysis of daily activities by querying, embedding, and clustering, and fall risk detection among older adults based on expert knowledge. As a result, we are able to develop a support tool that detects the fall risk with 1.0 precision, 0.6 recall, and 0.75 F1-score and visualize it with an explanation of its rationale.

In this study, we proposed a method that quantifies the importance of each piece of information by using a probability distribution. Our proposed method improves an existing method by 7.7% and 7.3% in H@1 on two datasets (FB15K-DB15K, FB15K-YAGO15K). Qualitative experiments also showed that the importance of information quantified by uncertainty successfully captured data that was not useful for information retrieval. Our qualitative experiments also show that the importance of information, quantified by uncertainty, effectively captures data that is not beneficial for information retrieval. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; entity alignment; information retrieval; knowledge representation; knowledge-based systems; multi-modal learning,Data visualization; Information retrieval; Job analysis; Knowledge graph; Probability distributions; Uncertainty analysis; Entity alignment; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-based systems; Knowledge-representation; Multi-modal; Multi-modal learning; Probability: distributions; Supplementary information; Task analysis; Uncertainty; Search engines,FALSE

As a result, the scope of distributed representations has expanded in machine learning and natural language processing. As these approaches can be used to effectively identify and analyze hot topic trends in large datasets. However, previous research has shown that analyzing sequential periods in data streams to detect hot topic trends can be challenging, particularly when dealing with large datasets. Moreover, existing methods often fail to accurately capture the semantic relationships between words over different time periods, limiting their effectiveness in trend prediction and relationship analysis. This paper aims to utilize a distributed representations approach to detect hot topic trends in streaming text data. For this purpose, we build a sequential evolution model for a streaming news website to identify hot topic trends in streaming text data. Additionally, we create a visual display model and knowledge graph to further enhance our proposed approach. To achieve this, we begin by collecting streaming news data from the web and dividing it chronologically into several datasets. In addition, word2vec models are built in different periods for each dataset. Finally, we compare the relationship of any target word in sequential word2vec models and analyze its evolutionary process. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect hot topic trends and provide a graphical representation of any raw data that cannot be easily designed using traditional methods.  © 2013 IEEE.",distributed representations; knowledge graph; news sequential evolution model; stream text analysis; Topic trends; visual display model,Knowledge graph; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Market Research; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Distributed database; Distributed representation; Evolution modeling; Knowledge graphs; Market researches; Sequence; Sequential evolution model; Social networking (online); Text analysis; Topic trend; Word2vec; Semantics,FALSE

To support these applications with a high-quality vector representation, numerous studies have proposed various knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. However, most of these models primarily focus on the design of new scoring functions, disregarding the crucial role of the loss function during the model training stage. In light of this, we propose a new exponential weight coefficient loss function, named EwLoss, which can be incorporated into any typical KGE model. This loss function enables the model to better distinguish between triplets that are otherwise difficult to differentiate. Consequently, the model can learn the features of these challenging triplets more effectively, leading to improved embedding vectors. By conducting experiments on four commonly used data sets, where EwLoss is applied to six representative models, we demonstrate the superiority of EwLoss in distinguishing such hard-to-distinguish triplets. Moreover, we observe that the performance of the embedding models is significantly enhanced when utilizing EwLoss. © 2013 IEEE.",Difficult-to-distinguish samples; easy-to-distinguish samples; knowledge graph; knowledge graph embedding model; loss function; negative sampling; negative triplets,Knowledge graph; Computational modelling; Difficult-to-distinguish sample; Easy-to-distinguish sample; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph embedding model; Knowledge graphs; Loss functions; Loss measurement; Negative sampling; Negative triplet; Sampling method; Semantics,FALSE

Meanwhile, the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various animal hospitals.

Using this information to recommend satisfactory cloud products is a challenge. Previous studies focused on similar information of users and products while neglecting relevance; therefore, they could not create recommendation approaches that account for functional dependencies among cloud products. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a cloud product set recommendation model based on a hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) with a pre-post correlation of product functionality. There are two main contributions: First, we constructed a cloud product functionality and performance KG using the dependency information of layers and entities to represent complicated pre-post logical connections. The KG was designed according to the cloud service model. Second, we designed an improved PageRank algorithm to obtain the importance weight for each functionality and performance, which replaces the original average method with the proportion of connection weight. We considered the release time of the functionality, launch time of the product, and last update time of the product as crucial factors in the recommendation score to reflect the importance of the functionality and current development stage of the product. Finally, our method recommended a product set based on the weighted scores from the above results. In addition, we constructed a cloud product functionality dataset containing 339 functionalities.

A text summarization task summarizes textual information into a short description, whereas an image collection summarization task summarizes an image collection into images or textual representation in which the challenge is to understand the relationship between images. In recent years, scene-graph generation has shown the advantage of describing the visual contexts of a single-image, and incorporating external knowledge into the scene-graph generation model has also given effective directions for unseen single-image scene-graph generation. While external knowledge has been implemented in related work, it is still challenging to use this information efficiently for relationship estimation during the summarization. Following this trend, in this paper, we propose a novel scene-graph-based image-collection summarization model that aims to generate a summarized scene-graph of an image collection. The key idea of the proposed method is to enhance the relation predictor toward relationships between images in an image collection incorporating knowledge graphs as external knowledge for training a model. With this approach, we build an end-to-end framework that can generate a summarized scene graph of an image collection. To evaluate the proposed method, we also build an extended annotated MS-COCO dataset for this task and introduce an evaluation process that focuses on estimating the similarity between a summarized scene graph and ground-truth scene graphs. Traditional evaluation focuses on calculating precision and recall scores, which involve true positive predictions without balancing precision and recall. Meanwhile, the proposed evaluation process focuses on calculating the F-score of the similarity between a summarized scene graph and ground-truth scene graphs, which aims to balance both false positives and false negatives.

Hypergraphs have shown remarkable capabilities in dealing with the diversity of multi-source information, especially in modeling high-order user-item relationships. However, most hypergraph research focuses on constructing hypergraphs using a particular type of hyperedge, which might not fully capture the high-order implicit associations among heterogeneous information sources. Furthermore, existing Hypergraph Attention Networks (Hyper-GAT), mainly emphasizes on information propagation between nodes and hyperedges, insufficiently exploring density information within complex hyperedges. Moreover, when hypergraphs combine data from multiple heterogeneous graphs, redundant information from different viewpoints can reduce the effectiveness of multivariate modeling hyperedges. Thus, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on multi-source heterogeneous hypergraphs and contrastive learning (MHCLR), which improves recommendation accuracy through multi-source information fusion and higher-order information correlation. First, multi-source heterogeneous hypergraphs (MHC) are generated by combining distance, behavior, attribute, and prediction hyperedges. We mine associations among multi-source information, enhancing high-order semantic connections among users and items. Then, a Spatial Density Hypergraph Attention Network (SD-HGAT) is proposed based on composite hyperedges, which enriches the user and item embedding representations by focusing on nodes and hyperedges density. Finally, we design a multiple cross view contrastive learning (MCC) that compares views centered around knowledge graphs with hypergraphs, improving the accuracy of multivariate relationship modeling and enabling multi-level user profiling construction.

However, most existing multimodal named entity recognition algorithms do not consider the correlation between text and images. They either use visual features of images as the attention of the text modality or fuse them with textual features. In the case of multimodal tweets containing both text and images, three categories of data can be identified based on the correlation between the two: text that is related to images, text that is partially related to images, and text that is not related to images. Using irrelevant or partially relevant image features as text cross-modal attention can result in incorrect text representation, ultimately leading to misclassification of entities and negatively impacting the model's performance.

Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication. Following that, we organize the design of the communication system into three dimensions, i.e., semantic information (SI) extraction, SI transmission, and SI metrics. For each dimension, we review existing techniques and discuss their benefits and limitations, as well as the remaining challenges. Then, we introduce the potential applications of SemCom in 6G and portray the vision of future SemCom-empowered network architecture. Finally, we outline future research opportunities.

Our framework goes beyond current recognition systems that lack the capability to reason beyond stack of convolutions. The framework consists of two core modules: A local module that uses spatial memory [4] to store previous beliefs with parallel updates; and a global graph-reasoning module. Our graph module has three components: A) a knowledge graph where we represent classes as nodes and build edges to encode different types of semantic relationships between them; b) a region graph of the current image where regions in the image are nodes and spatial relationships between these regions are edges; c) an assignment graph that assigns regions to classes. Both the local module and the global module roll-out iteratively and cross-feed predictions to each other to refine estimates. The final predictions are made by combining the best of both modules with an attention mechanism. We show strong performance over plain ConvNets, e.g. achieving an 8.4% absolute improvement on ADE [55] measured by per-class average precision.

To this end, we propose a Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules: Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to generate the final reports.

However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel model entitled MMKGR (Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning). Specifically, the model contains the following two components: (1) a unified gate-attention network which is designed to generate effective multi-modal complementary features through sufficient attention interaction and noise reduction; (2) a complementary feature-aware reinforcement learning method which is proposed to predict missing elements by performing the multi-hop reasoning process, based on the features obtained in component (1). The experimental results demonstrate that MMKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the MKG reasoning task.  © 2023 IEEE.",Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning; Multi-modal fusion; Multi-modal knowledge graph,Image enhancement; Learning systems; Noise abatement; Reinforcement learning; Auxiliary data; Complementary features; Embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning; Multi-hops; Multi-modal; Multi-modal fusion; Multi-modal knowledge graph; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Despite their promising benefits, building business KG necessitates solving prohibitive issues of deficient structure and multiple modalities. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the practical challenges related to building KG in non-trivial real-world systems. We introduce the process of building an open business knowledge graph (OpenBG) derived from a well-known enterprise, Alibaba Group. Specifically, we define a core ontology to cover various abstract products and consumption demands, with fine-grained taxonomy and multimodal facts in deployed applications. OpenBG is an open business KG of unprecedented scale: 2.6 billion triples with more than 88 million entities covering over 1 million core classes/concepts and 2,681 types of relations. We release all the open resources (OpenBG benchmarks) derived from it for the community and report experimental results of KG-centric tasks. We also run up an online competition based on OpenBG benchmarks, and has attracted thousands of teams. We further pre-train OpenBG and apply it to many KG-enhanced downstream tasks in business scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of billion-scale multimodal knowledge for e-commerce.

The extrapolation of TKG is to predict unknowable facts happening in the future, holding significant practical value across diverse fields. Most extrapolation studies in TKGs focus on modeling global historical fact repeating and cyclic patterns, as well as local historical adjacent fact evolution patterns, showing promising performance in predicting future un-known facts. Yet, existing methods still face two major challenges: (1) They usually neglect the importance of historical information in KG snapshots related to the queries when encoding the local and global historical information; (2) They exhibit weak anti-noise capabilities, which hinders their performance when the inputs are contaminated with noise. To this end, we propose a novel Local-global history-aware Contrastive Learning model (LogCL) for TKG reasoning, which adopts contrastive learning to better guide the fusion of local and global historical information and enhance the ability to resist interference. Specifically, for the first challenge, LogCL proposes an entity-aware attention mechanism applied to the local and global historical facts encoder, which captures the key historical information related to queries. For the latter issue, LogCL designs a local-global query contrast module, effectively improving the robustness of the model. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LogCL delivers better and more robust performance than the state-of-the-art baselines.

Originally focusing on text, they have been enhanced with multimodal capabilities in recent works that successfully built visual instruction following assistants. As far as the graph modality goes, however, no such assistants have yet been developed. Graph structures are complex in that they represent relation between different features and are permutation invariant. Moreover, representing them in purely textual form does not always lead to good LLM performance even for finetuned models. As a result, there is a need to develop a new method to integrate graphs in LLMs for general graph understanding. This work explores the integration of the graph modality in LLM for general graph instruction following tasks. It aims at producing a deep learning model that enhances an underlying LLM with graph embeddings and trains it to understand them and to produce, given an instruction, an answer grounded in the graph representation.

However, obtaining this kind of information is not a trivial task. The conventional method involves a labor-intensive and inefficient manual inspection process for each building. Nowadays, a few methods have explored to use remote sensing images and some building-related knowledge (BRK) to realize automated BST recognition. However, these methods have many limitations, such as insufficient mining of multimodal information and difficulty obtaining BRK, which hinders their promotion and practical use. To alleviate the shortcomings above, we propose a deep multimodal fusion model, which combines satellite optical remote sensing image, aerial synthetic aperture radar image, and BRK (roof type, color, and group pattern) obtained by domain experts to achieve accurate automatic reasoning of BSTs. Specifically, first, we use a pseudo-siamese network to extract the image feature. Second, a knowledge graph (KG) based on the BRK is constructed, and then, we use a graph attention network to extract the semantic feature from the KG. Third, we propose a novel multistage gated fusion mechanism to fuse the image and semantic feature. Our method's best overall accuracy and kappa coefficient on the dataset collected in the study area are 90.35% and 0.83, which outperforms a series of existing methods.

It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories.

The knowledge graph (KG), due to its expressive structural and semantic representation capabilities, has been increasingly used for capturing auxiliary information for recommender systems, such as the recent development of graph neural network (GNN) based models for KG-aware recommendation. Nevertheless, these models have the shortcoming of insufficient node interactions or improper node weights during information propagation, which limits the performance of recommender systems. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-dimension Interaction based attentional Knowledge Graph Neural Network (MI-KGNN) for enhanced KG-aware recommendation. MI-KGNN characterizes similarities between users and items through information propagation and aggregation in knowledge graphs. As such, it can optimize the updating direction of node representation by fully exploring multi-dimension interactions among nodes during information propagation. In addition, MI-KGNN introduces a dual attention mechanism, which allows users and items to jointly determine the weight of neighbor nodes. As a result, MI-KGNN can effectively capture and represent both structural (i.e., the topology of interactions) and semantic information (i.e., the weight of interactions) in the knowledge graph. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for top-K recommendation. Specifically, the recall rate is increased by 5.78%, 6.66%, and 3.22% on three public datasets, compared with the best performance of existing methods.  © 2022 IEEE.",Dual attention mechanism; graph neural networks; information propagation; knowledge graph; recommender system,Backpropagation; Big data; Graph neural networks; Online systems; Recommender systems; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Collaboration; Dual attention mechanism; Explicit information; Graph neural networks; Information propagation; Knowledge graphs; Multi dimensions; Social networking (online); Knowledge graph,FALSE

In such a system, a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) is operated at an edge server as a ""remote brain""to guide remote robots on environmental exploration or task execution. In this paper, we present a new air-interface framework targeting the said systems, called knowledge-based robotic semantic communications (SemCom), which consists of a protocol and relevant transmission techniques. First, the proposed robotic SemCom protocol defines a sequence of system operations for executing a given robotic task. They include identification of all task-relevant knowledge paths (KPs) on the KG, semantic matching between KG and object classifier, and uploading of robot's observations for objects recognition and feasible KP identification. Next, to support ultra-low-latency (observation) feature transmission (ULL-FT), we propose a novel transmission approach that exploits classifier's robustness, which is measured by classification margin, to compensate for a high bit error probability (BEP) resulting from ultra-low-latency transmission (e.g., short packet and/or no coding). By utilizing the tractable Gaussian mixture (GM) model, we mathematically derive the relation between BEP and classification margin under constraints on classification accuracy and transmission latency. The result sheds light on system requirements to support ULL-FT. Furthermore, for the case where the classification margin is insufficient for coping with channel distortion, we enhance the ULL-FT approach by studying retransmission and multi-view classification for enlarging the margin and further quantifying corresponding requirements. Finally, experiments using deep neural networks as classifier models and real datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of ULL-FT in communication latency reduction while providing a guarantee on accurate feasible KP identification. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",edge inference; knowledge graph; Robotic intelligence; semantic communications; ultra-low-latency,Deep neural networks; Risk assessment; Robot programming; Classification margins; Edge inference; Edge intelligence; Knowledge based; Knowledge graphs; Low latency; Path identifications; Robotic intelligence; Semantic communication; Ultra-low-latency; Knowledge graph,FALSE

By using text as information supporting the visual query, the retrieval system gains in usability, but at the same time faces difficulties due to the diversity of visual signals that cannot be summarized by a short caption only. For this reason, as a matching-based task, cross-modal text-image retrieval often suffers from information asymmetry between text and images. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Text-Image Retrieval (KTIR) method for remote sensing images. By mining relevant information from an external knowledge graph, KTIR enriches the text scope available in the search query and alleviates the information gaps between text and images for better matching. Moreover, by integrating domain-specific knowledge, KTIR also enhances the adaptation of pretrained vision-language models to remote sensing applications.

To enable such a collaboration, this paper proposes a federated platform, called Future Mobility Sensing Advisor (FMSA), which can 1) manage the three elements through standardized interfaces separately and uniformly; 2) create a fully connected knowledge graph to orchestrate the three elements efficiently and effectively; 3) support the client-server interaction in centralized and federated modes to handle service requests and edge resources with various availability and accessibilities jointly and adaptively; and 4) accommodate various mobility services to foster harmonious and sustainable mobility tenderly and invisibly. Moreover, the efficiency and effectiveness of the platform are also tested through a performance evaluation, and a pilot supported at the Great Boston Area, respectively.

While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to insufficient integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG’s configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 3.46±0.01, 14.76±0.09%, and 5.08±0.01, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model’s ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting. © 2024 IEEE.

To better comprehend long complicated sentences and obtain accurate aspect-specific information, linguistic and commonsense knowledge are generally required in this task. However, most current methods employ complicated and inefficient approaches to incorporate external knowledge, e.g., directly searching the graph nodes. Additionally, the complementarity between external knowledge and linguistic information has not been thoroughly studied. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph augmented network (KGAN), which aims to effectively incorporate external knowledge with explicitly syntactic and contextual information. In particular, KGAN captures the sentiment feature representations from multiple different perspectives, i.e., context-, syntax- and knowledge-based. First, KGAN learns the contextual and syntactic representations in parallel to fully extract the semantic features. Then, KGAN integrates the knowledge graphs into the embedding space, based on which the aspect-specific knowledge representations are further obtained via an attention mechanism. Last, we propose a hierarchical fusion module to complement these multi-view representations in a local-to-global manner.

Towards this end, we study the problem of semi-supervised universal graph classification, which not only identifies graph samples which do not belong to known classes, but also classifies the remaining samples into their respective classes. This problem is challenging due to a severe lack of labels and potential class shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network framework named UGNN, which makes the best of unlabeled data from the subgraph perspective. To tackle class shifts, we estimate the certainty of unlabeled graphs using multiple subgraphs, which facilities the discovery of unlabeled data from unknown categories. Moreover, we construct semantic prototypes in the embedding space for both known and unknown categories and utilize posterior prototype assignments inferred from the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to learn from abundant unlabeled graphs across different subgraph views.

Meanwhile, contrastive learning has been widely leveraged in graph learning as an effective mechanism to enhance the discriminative capacity of the learned representations. However, the complex structures of KG make it hard to construct appropriate contrastive pairs. Only a few attempts have integrated contrastive learning strategies with KGE. But, most of them rely on language models (e.g., Bert) for contrastive pair construction instead of fully mining information underlying the graph structure, hindering expressive ability. Surprisingly, we find that the entities within a relational symmetrical structure are usually similar and correlated. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph contrastive learning framework based on relation-symmetrical structure, KGE-SymCL, which mines symmetrical structure information in KGs to enhance the discriminative ability of KGE models. Concretely, a plug-and-play approach is proposed by taking entities in the relation-symmetrical positions as positive pairs. Besides, a self-supervised alignment loss is designed to pull together positive pairs.

Many machine learning-based methods have been proposed for this task. However, to our best knowledge, existing methods all require manually crafted seed alignments, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first fully automatic alignment method named AutoAlign, which does not require any manually crafted seed alignments. Specifically, for predicate embeddings, AutoAlign constructs a predicate-proximity-graph with the help of large language models to automatically capture the similarity between predicates across two KGs. For entity embeddings, AutoAlign first computes the entity embeddings of each KG independently using TransE, and then shifts the two KGs' entity embeddings into the same vector space by computing the similarity between entities based on their attributes. Thus, both predicate alignment and entity alignment can be done without manually crafted seed alignments. AutoAlign is not only fully automatic, but also highly effective. Experiments using real-world KGs show that AutoAlign improves the performance of entity alignment significantly compared to state-of-the-art methods.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.",Attribute embeddings; deep learning; entity alignment; knowledge base; knowledge graph; knowledge graph alignment; large language model; predicate proximity graph; representation learning,Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Vector spaces; Attribute embedding; Deep learning; Embeddings; Entity alignment; Knowledge base; Knowledge graph alignment; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Predicate proximity graph; Proximity graphs; Representation learning; Alignment,FALSE

In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from three weaknesses. First, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential models, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences for veracity checking. Second, they underestimate much redundant information contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. Third, insufficient data utilization limits the separability and reliability of representations captured by the model, which are sensitive to local evidence. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic structure mining framework with ConTRAstive Learning, namely GETRAL in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we first model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Then the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Finally, the supervised contrastive learning accompanied with adversarial augmented instances is applied to make full use of data and strengthen the representation learning. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GETRAL over the state-of-the-arts and validated the efficacy of semantic mining with graph structure and contrastive learning. © 2024 IEEE.",contrastive learning; Evidence-based fake news detection; graph neural networks,Fake detection; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Job analysis; Learning systems; Reliability analysis; Semantic Web; Contrastive learning; Evidence-based; Evidence-based fake news detection; Fake news; Graph neural networks; Graph structures; Sequential modeling; Task analysis; Termination of employment; Semantics,FALSE

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia, and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and, simultaneously, leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely: 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",bidirectional reasoning; generative pre-training; knowledge graphs; large language models; Natural language processing; roadmap,Computational linguistics; Graphic methods; Job analysis; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Bidirectional reasoning; Chatbots; Cognition; Decoding; Generative pre-training; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Pre-training; Predictive models; Roadmap; Task analysis; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Due to their powerful emergent abilities, recent LLMs are considered as a possible alternative to structured knowledge bases like knowledge graphs (KGs). However, while LLMs are proficient at learning probabilistic language patterns and engaging in conversations with humans, they, like previous smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), still have difficulty in recalling facts while generating knowledge-grounded contents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed enhancing data-driven PLMs with knowledge-based KGs to incorporate explicit factual knowledge into PLMs, thus improving their performance in generating texts requiring factual knowledge and providing more informed responses to user queries. This paper reviews the studies on enhancing PLMs with KGs, detailing existing knowledge graph enhanced pre-trained language models (KGPLMs) as well as their applications.

Scene knowledge is important for an agent to understand the surroundings and make correct decisions in the varied open world. Currently, knowledge base for embodied tasks is missing and most existing work use general knowledge base or pre-trained models to enhance the intelligence of an agent. For conventional knowledge base, it is sparse, insufficient in capacity and cost in data collection. For pre-trained models, they face the uncertainty of knowledge and hard maintenance. To overcome the challenges of scene knowledge, we propose a scene-driven multimodal knowledge graph (Scene-MMKG) construction method combining conventional knowledge engineering and large language models. A unified scene knowledge injection framework is introduced for knowledge representation. To evaluate the advantages of our proposed method, we instantiate Scene-MMKG considering typical indoor robotic functionalities (Manipulation and Mobility), named ManipMob-MMKG. Comparisons in characteristics indicate our instantiated ManipMob-MMKG has broad superiority on data-collection efficiency and knowledge quality.

It offers an effective way to capture users' dynamic preferences with multi-turn conversations. However, most current studies center on the recommendation aspect while over-simplifying the conversation process. The negligence of complexity in data structure and conversation flow hinders their practicality and utility. In reality, there exist various relationships among slots and values, while users' requirements may dynamically adjust or change. Moreover, the conversation often involves visual modality to facilitate the conversation. These actually call for a more advanced internal state representation of the dialogue and a proper reasoning scheme to guide the decision making process. In this paper, we explore multiple facets of multimodal conversational recommendation and try to address the above mentioned challenges. In particular, we represent the structured back-end database as a multimodal knowledge graph which captures the various relations and evidence in different modalities. The user preferences expressed via conversation utterances will then be gradually updated to the state graph with clear polarity. Based on these, we train an end-to-end State Graph-based Reasoning model (SGR) to perform reasoning over the whole state graph. The prediction of our proposed model benefits from the structure of the graph. It not only allows for zero-shot reasoning for items unseen in training conversations, but also provides a natural way to explain the policies.

The feature vectors, visual relationships, and their symbolic labels are stored in KD-Tree data structures which can be used to predict the label of objects and visual relationships later.

However, most existing KG embedding models neglect space and, therefore, do not perform well when applied to (geo)spatial data and tasks. Most models that do consider space primarily rely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational complexity during training while still losing information beyond the relative distance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KG embedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such as point coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KG embedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types of spatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as a set of geographic query–answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performance of SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that SE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo data set for the geographic logic query answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our spatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale of different geographic entities.

This poses a challenge in efficiently gathering and aligning the data into a unified framework to derive insights related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Thus, using Information Extraction (IE) methods becomes an intuitive choice for delivering insightful and actionable data to stakeholders. In this study, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs), In-Context Learning, and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to extract structured insights related to ESG aspects from companies’ sustainability reports. We then leverage graph-based representations to conduct statistical analyses concerning the extracted insights. These analyses revealed that ESG criteria cover a wide range of topics, exceeding 500, often beyond those considered in existing categorizations, and are addressed by companies through a variety of initiatives. Moreover, disclosure similarities emerged among companies from the same region or sector, validating ongoing hypotheses in the ESG literature. Lastly, by incorporating additional company attributes into our analyses, we investigated which factors impact the most on companies’ ESG ratings, showing that ESG disclosure affects the obtained ratings more than other financial or company data. © The Author(s) 2024.",Bipartite graph analyses; ESG dimensions; In-context learning; Interpretability; Knowledge graphs; Large language models; Non-financial disclosures,"Computational linguistics; Data mining; Finance; Gold; Knowledge graph; Learning systems; Sustainable development; Bipartite graph analyze; Bipartite graphs; Context learning; Environmental, social, and governance dimension; Financial disclosure; Graph analysis; In contexts; In-context learning; Interpretability; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Non-financial disclosure; Graphic methods",FALSE

Consequently this method offers a high level of flexibility for querying and allows, among others, the expression of composite interests' queries on remote linked data sources.

For this purpose, primitives (i.e., proxies) and their relationships (e.g., contact, support, hierarchical) are stored in an abstraction graph, while the different categories of prior knowledge necessary for processing are stored separately in a knowledge graph. These graphs complement each other bidirectionally, and are processed concurrently.

This can be achieved by explicit KG reasoning, where a model starts from a user node, sequentially determines the next step, and walks towards an item node of potential interest to the user. However, this is challenging due to the huge search space, unknown destination, and sparse signals over the KG, so informative and effective guidance is needed to achieve a satisfactory recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a CoArse-to-FinE neural symbolic reasoning approach (CAFE). It first generates user profiles as coarse sketches of user behaviors, which subsequently guide a path-finding process to derive reasoning paths for recommendations as fine-grained predictions. User profiles can capture prominent user behaviors from the history, and provide valuable signals about which kinds of path patterns are more likely to lead to potential items of interest for the user. To better exploit the user profiles, an improved path-finding algorithm called Profile-guided Path Reasoning (PPR) is also developed, which leverages an inventory of neural symbolic reasoning modules to effectively and efficiently find a batch of paths over a large-scale KG.

In this paper, we analyze different groups of users according to their level of activity, and find that bias exists in recommendation performance between different groups.

In recent years, various types of side information have been explored to alleviate this problem. Among them, knowledge graph (KG) has attracted extensive research interests as it can encode users/items and their associated attributes in the graph structure to preserve the relation information. In contrast, less attention has been paid to the item-item co-occurrence information (i.e., co-view), which contains rich item-item similarity information. It provides information from a perspective different from the user/item-attribute graph and is also valuable for the CF recommendation models. In this work, we make an effort to study the potential of integrating both types of side information (i.e., KG and item-item co-occurrence data) for recommendation. To achieve the goal, we propose a unified graph-based recommendation model (UGRec), which integrates the traditional directed relations in KG and the undirected item-item co-occurrence relations simultaneously. In particular, for a directed relation, we transform the head and tail entities into the corresponding relation space to model their relation; and for an undirected co-occurrence relation, we project head and tail entities into a unique hyperplane in the entity space to minimize their distance. In addition, a head-tail relation-aware attentive mechanism is designed for fine-grained relation modeling. © 2021 ACM.",attention mechanism; knowledge graph; metric learning; recommendation,Collaborative filtering; Graph structures; Graphic methods; Knowledge representation; Co-occurrence informations; Corresponding relations; Item similarity; Knowledge graphs; Performance degradation; Relation information; Research interests; Side information; Recommender systems,FALSE

Even if there are promising new approaches for performing zero-shot learning (ZSL), they are not designed for a cross-domain settings. We propose Cross Domain Zero Shot Named Entity Recognition with Knowledge Graph (DOZEN), which learns the relations between entities across different domains from an existing ontology of external knowledge and a set of analogies linking entities and domains. Experiments performed on both large scale and domain-specific datasets indicate that DOZEN is the most suitable option to extracts unseen entities in a target dataset from a different domain. © 2021 Owner/Author.",cross-domain machine learning; knowledge graph; named entity recognition; natural language processing; zero-shot learning,Information retrieval; Knowledge representation; Large dataset; Annotated datasets; Different domains; Domain specific; External knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; State of the art; Natural language processing systems,FALSE

However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly large fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal information. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on speculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone. To add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective because of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test folds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit these weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque and their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important limitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only of the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the correct(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a key structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and build a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner identifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity which can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage mentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQA_S3, a subset of OKVQA annotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from scratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system, S3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent competitive baselines.

Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performance in some benchmarks. Despite the fast-growing literature on the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are vastly more represented than others; this allows LP methods to exhibit good results by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature.

Querying KGs remains a foundational and challenging problem due to their size and complexity. Promising approaches to tackle this problem include embedding the KG units (e.g., entities and relations) in a Euclidean space such that the query embedding contains the information relevant to its results. These approaches, however, fail to capture the hierarchical nature and semantic information of the entities present in the graph. Additionally, most of these approaches only utilize multi-hop queries (that can be modeled by simple translation operations) to learn embeddings and ignore more complex operations such as intersection, and union of simpler queries. To tackle such complex operations, in this paper, we formulate KG representation learning as a self-supervised logical query reasoning problem that utilizes translation, intersection and union queries over KGs. We propose Hyperboloid Embeddings (HypE), a novel self-supervised dynamic reasoning framework, that utilizes positive first-order existential queries on a KG to learn representations of its entities and relations as hyperboloids in a PoincarA© ball. HypE models the positive first-order queries as geometrical translation, intersection, and union. For the problem of KG reasoning in real-world datasets, the proposed HypE model significantly outperforms the state-of-the art results. We also apply HypE to an anomaly detection task on a popular e-commerce website product taxonomy as well as hierarchically organized web articles and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing baseline methods. Finally, we also visualize the learned HypE embeddings in a PoincarA© ball to clearly interpret and comprehend the representation space.

The key of implementing ZSL is to leverage the prior knowledge of classes which builds the semantic relationship between classes and enables the transfer of the learned models (e.g., features) from training classes (i.e., seen classes) to unseen classes. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods are relatively limited with incomplete semantics. In this paper, we explore richer and more competitive prior knowledge to model the inter-class relationship for ZSL via ontology-based knowledge representation and semantic embedding. Meanwhile, to address the data imbalance between seen classes and unseen classes, we developed a generative ZSL framework with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our main findings include: (i) an ontology-enhanced ZSL framework that can be applied to different domains, such as image classification (IMGC) and knowledge graph completion (KGC); (ii) a comprehensive evaluation with multiple zero-shot datasets from different domains, where our method often achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models. In particular, on four representative ZSL baselines of IMGC, the ontology-based class semantics outperform the previous priors e.g., the word embeddings of classes by an average of 12.4 accuracy points in the standard ZSL across two example datasets (see Figure 4).

The value of Wikidata is directly linked to the rich information associated with each entity - that is, the properties describing each entity as well as the relationships to other entities. Despite the tremendous manual and automatic efforts the community invested in the Wikidata project, the growing number of entities (now more than 100 million) presents multiple challenges in terms of knowledge gaps in the graph that are hard to track. To help guide the community in filling the gaps in Wikidata, we propose to identify and rank the properties that an entity might be missing. In this work, we focus on entities with a dedicated Wikipedia page in any language to make predictions directly based on textual content. We show that this problem can be formulated as a multi-label classification problem where every property defined in Wikidata is a potential label. Our main contribution, Wiki2Prop, solves this problem using a multimodal Deep Learning method to predict which properties should be attached to a given entity, using its Wikipedia page embeddings. Moreover, Wiki2Prop is able to incorporate additional features in the form of multilingual embeddings and multimodal data such as images whenever available. We empirically evaluate our approach against the state of the art and show how Wiki2Prop significantly outperforms its competitors for the task of property prediction in Wikidata, and how the use of multilingual and multimodal data improves the results further. Finally, we make Wiki2Prop available as a property recommender system that can be activated and used directly in the context of a Wikidata entity page.

For examples, knowledge graphs share a number of named entities though they may have different relation schema; collaboration networks on publications and awarded projects share some researcher nodes who are authors and investigators, respectively; people use multiple web services, shopping, tweeting, rating movies, and some may register the same email account across the platforms. In this paper, I propose partially aligned graph convolutional networks to learn node representations across the models.

However, a majority of the existing algorithms focus on exploiting visual features of the videos and do not consider the mining of relationships, which include spatial relationships between human and scene elements as well as causal relationships in temporal action sequences. In fact, human beings are good at using spatial and causal relational reasoning mechanism to predict the actions of others. Inspired by this idea, we proposed a Spatial and Causal Relationship based Graph Reasoning Network (SCR-Graph), which can be used to predict human actions by modeling the action-scene relationship, and causal relationship between actions, in spatial and temporal dimensions respectively. Here, in spatial dimension, a hierarchical graph attention module is designed by iteratively aggregating the features of different kinds of scene elements in different level. In temporal dimension, we designed a knowledge graph based causal reasoning module and map the past actions to temporal causal features through Diffusion RNN. Finally, we integrated the causality features into the heterogeneous graph in the form of shadow node, and introduced a self-attention module to determine the time when the knowledge graph information should be activated.

However, despite the enormous effort conducted by contributing communities, community-based knowledge graphs may be incomplete and integrate duplicated data and metadata. We tackle the problem of enhancing query answering against incomplete community-based knowledge graphs by proposing an efficient query processing approach to estimate answer completeness and increase the results. It assumes that community-based knowledge graphs comprise synonym predicates that complement knowledge graph triples required to raise query answering completeness.

Our preliminary analysis shows that our approach improves query answer completeness. However, queries can be expanded with some similar predicates which do not lead to complete answers.

Recent single modality text work has shown knowledge injection into pre-trained language models, specifically entity enhanced knowledge graph embeddings, can improve performance on downstream entity-centric tasks. In this work, we empirically study how and whether such methods, applied in a bi-modal setting, can improve an existing VQA system's performance on the KBVQA task. We experiment with two large publicly available VQA datasets, (1) KVQA which contains mostly rare Wikipedia entities and (2) OKVQA which is less entity-centric and more aligned with common sense reasoning. Both lack explicit entity spans, and we study the effect of different weakly supervised and manual methods for obtaining them. Additionally, we analyze how recently proposed bi-modal and single modal attention explanations are affected by the incorporation of such entity enhanced representations. Our results show substantially improved performance on the KBVQA task without the need for additional costly pre-training, and we provide insights for when entity knowledge injection helps improve a model's understanding.

Motivated by the lack of COVID-19 relevant knowledge in existing solutions, we construct a novel crowdsource knowledge graph based approach to incorporate the COVID-19 knowledge facts by leveraging the collaborative efforts of expert and non-expert crowd workers. Two important challenges exist in developing our solution: i) how to effectively coordinate the crowd efforts from both expert and non-expert workers to generate the relevant knowledge facts for detecting COVID-19 misinformation; ii) How to leverage the knowledge facts from the constructed knowledge graph to accurately explain the detected COVID-19 misinformation. To address the above challenges, we develop HC-COVID, a hierarchical crowdsource knowledge graph based framework that explicitly models the COVID-19 knowledge facts contributed by crowd workers with different levels of expertise and accurately identifies the related knowledge facts to explain the detection results.

The major challenge of this task is how to identify the true fine-grained semantic correspondence between videos and texts, using only the document-level correspondence. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective two-stream framework which takes the concept information into account and introduces a new branch of semantic-level matching. We further propose a concept propagation mechanism for mining the latent semantics in videos and achieving enriched representations. The concept propagation is achieved by building a commonsense graph distilled from ConceptNet with concepts extracted from videos and captions. The original concepts of videos are detected by pretrained detectors as the initial concept representations. By conducting attentional graph reasoning on the commonsense graph with the guidance of external knowledge, we can extend some new concepts in a detector-free manner for further enriching the video representations. In addition, a propagated BCE loss is designed for supervising the concept propagation procedure. Common space learning is then constructed for cross-modal matching. We conduct extensive experiments on various baseline models and several benchmark datasets.

Because it concentrates on nominal entities and their relationships, traditional knowledge graphs are static and encyclopedic in nature. On this basis, event knowledge graph (Event KG) models the temporal and spatial dynamics by text processing to facilitate downstream applications, such as question-answering, recommendation and intelligent search. Existing KG research, on the other hand, mostly focuses on text processing and static facts, ignoring the vast quantity of dynamic behavioral information included in photos, movies, and pre-trained neural networks. In addition, no effort has been done to include behavioral intelligence information into the knowedge graph for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robot learning. In this paper, we propose a noval dynamic knowledge and skill graph (KSG), and then we develop a basic and specific KSG based on CN-DBpedia. The nodes are divided into entity and attribute nodes, with entity nodes containing the agent, environment, and skill (DRL policy or policy representation), and attribute nodes containing the entity description, pre-train network, and offline dataset. KSG can search for different agents' skills in various environments and provide transferable information for acquiring new skills. This is the first study that we are aware of that looks into dynamic KSG for skill retrieval and learning.

Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers.

Meanwhile, many text data are inherently grounded on a network structure, such as a hyperlink/citation network for online articles, and a user-item purchase network for e-commerce products. These graph structures capture rich semantic relationships, which can potentially augment low-resource text classification.

In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph pretraining model KGTransformer that could serve as a uniform KRF module in diverse KG-related tasks.

With the ability to integrate and analyze data in real-time, multimodal knowledge graphs offer a wealth of insights for smart city applications, such as monitoring traffic flow, air quality, public safety, and identifying potential hazards. Knowledge enrichment can enable a more comprehensive representation of multimodal data and intuitive decision-making with improved expressiveness and generalizability. However, challenges remain in effectively modelling the complex relationships between and within different types of modalities in data spaces and infusing common sense knowledge from external sources. This paper reviews the related literature and identifies major challenges and key requirements for effectively developing multimodal knowledge graphs for data spaces, and proposes an ontology for their construction.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",data spaces; knowledge graphs; multimodal data; smart city,Air quality; Decision making; Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Data space; Decisions makings; Knowledge graphs; Multi-modal; Multi-modal data; Multiple source; Potential hazards; Public safety; Real- time; Traffic flow; Smart city,FALSE

Consequently, increasing efforts focus on modeling multimodal user preference, and the pressing paradigm is to incorporate complete multimodal deep features of the items into the recommendation module. However, the existing studies ignore the mismatch problem between multimodal feature extraction (MFE) and user interest modeling (UIM). That is, MFE and UIM have different emphases. Specifically, MFE is migrated from and adapted to upstream tasks such as image classification. In addition, it is mainly a content-oriented and non-personalized process, while UIM, with its greater focus on understanding user interaction, is essentially a user-oriented and personalized process. Therefore, the direct incorporation of MFE into UIM for purely user-oriented tasks, tends to introduce a large number of preference-independent multimodal noise and contaminate the embedding representations in UIM.This paper aims at solving the mismatch problem between MFE and UIM, so as to generate high-quality embedding representations and better model multimodal user preferences. Towards this end, we develop a novel model, multimodal entity graph collaborative filtering, short for MEGCF. The UIM of the proposed model captures the semantic correlation between interactions and the features obtained from MFE, thus making a better match between MFE and UIM. More precisely, semantic-rich entities are first extracted from the multimodal data, since they are more relevant to user preferences than other multimodal information. These entities are then integrated into the user-item interaction graph. Afterwards, a symmetric linear Graph Convolution Network (GCN) module is constructed to perform message propagation over the graph, in order to capture both high-order semantic correlation and collaborative filtering signals. Finally, the sentiment information from the review data are used to fine-grainedly weight neighbor aggregation in the GCN, as it reflects the overall quality of the items, and therefore it is an important modality information related to user preferences.

However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ""negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks.

Though large efforts have been made to explore the complementary effect among multiple modalities, however, they may fail to fully absorb the comprehensive expression of abbreviated textual context and implicit visual indication. Even worse, the inevitable noisy data may cause inconsistency of different modalities during the learning process, which severely degenerates the performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-GraIned Multimodal InteraCtion Network (MIMIC) framework for solving the MEL task. Specifically, the unified inputs of mentions and entities are first encoded by textual/visual encoders separately, to extract global descriptive features and local detailed features. Then, to derive the similarity matching score for each mention-entity pair, we device three interaction units to comprehensively explore the intra-modal interaction and inter-modal fusion among features of entities and mentions. In particular, three modules, namely the Text-based Global-Local interaction Unit (TGLU), Vision-based DuaL interaction Unit (VDLU) and Cross-Modal Fusion-based interaction Unit (CMFU) are designed to capture and integrate the fine-grained representation lying in abbreviated text and implicit visual cues. Afterwards, we introduce a unit-consistency objective function via contrastive learning to avoid inconsistency and model degradation.

Recently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven as an effective scheme for handling the zero-shot task with large-scale and non-attribute data. Prior studies always embed relationships of seen and unseen objects into visual information from existing knowledge graphs to promote the cognitive ability of the unseen data. Actually, real-world knowledge is naturally formed by multimodal facts. Compared with ordinary structural knowledge from a graph perspective, multimodal KG can provide cognitive systems with fine-grained knowledge. For example, the text description and visual content can depict more critical details of a fact than only depending on knowledge triplets. Unfortunately, this multimodal fine-grained knowledge is largely unexploited due to the bottleneck of feature alignment between different modalities. To that end, we propose a multimodal intensive ZSL framework that matches regions of images with corresponding semantic embeddings via a designed dense attention module and self-calibration loss. It makes the semantic transfer process of our ZSL framework learns more differentiated knowledge between entities. Our model also gets rid of the performance limitation of only using rough global features. We conduct extensive experiments and evaluate our model on large-scale real-world data.

Also, a triplet (J.R.R., educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a qualifier such as (start time, 1911).

We define a context transformer and a prediction transformer to learn the representations based not only on the correlations between a triplet and its qualifiers but also on the numeric information. By learning compact representations of triplets and qualifiers and feeding them into the transformers, we reduce the computation cost of using transformers. Using HyNT, we can predict missing numeric values in addition to missing entities or relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph.

Existing works have shown the effectiveness of visual-semantic embedding and unimodal knowledge exploiting (e.g., textual knowledge) in connecting the image and text. However, they neglect the implicit multimodal knowledge relations between these two modalities when the image contains information that is not directly described in the text, hindering the ability to connect the image and text with the implicit semantic relations. For instance, an image shows a person next to the ""tap""but the pairing text description may only include the word ""wash,""missing the washing tool ""tap.""The implicit semantic relation between image object ""tap""and text word ""wash""can help to connect the above image and text. To sufficiently utilize the implicit multimodal knowledge relations, we propose a Multimodal Knowledge enhanced Visual-Semantic Embedding (MKVSE) approach building a multimodal knowledge graph to explicitly represent the implicit multimodal knowledge relations and injecting it to visual-semantic embedding for image-Text retrieval task. The contributions in this article can be summarized as follows: (1) Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MKG) is proposed to explicitly represent the implicit multimodal knowledge relations between the image and text as intra-modal semantic relations and inter-modal co-occurrence relations. Intra-modal semantic relations provide synonymy information that is implicit in the unimodal data such as the text corpus. And inter-modal co-occurrence relations characterize the co-occurrence correlations (such as temporal, causal, and logical) that are implicit in image-Text pairs. These two relations help establishing reliable image-Text connections in the higher-level semantic space. (2) Multimodal Graph Convolution Networks (MGCN) is proposed to reason on the MKG in two steps to sufficiently utilize the implicit multimodal knowledge relations. In the first step, MGCN focuses on the intra-modal relations to distinguish other entities in the semantic space. In the second step, MGCN focuses on the inter-modal relations to connect multimodal entities based on co-occurrence correlations. The two-step reasoning manner can sufficiently utilize the implicit semantic relations between two modal entities to enhance the embeddings of the image and text. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets, namely, Flickr30k and MSCOCO, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MKVSE approach in achieving state-of-The-Art performances.

Several MOOC platforms offer the service of course recommendation to users, to improve the learning experience of users.

To mitigate this gap, we examine an interesting problem of concept recommendation in this paper, which can be viewed as recommending knowledge to users in a fine-grained way. We put forward a novel approach, termed HinCRec-RL, for Concept Recommendation in MOOCs, which is based on Heterogeneous Information Networks and Reinforcement Learning. In particular, we propose to shape the problem of concept recommendation within a reinforcement learning framework to characterize the dynamic interaction between users and knowledge concepts in MOOCs. Furthermore, we propose to form the interactions among users, courses, videos, and concepts into a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to learn the semantic user representations better. We then employ an attentional graph neural network to represent the users in the HIN, based on meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset collected from a Chinese MOOC platform, XuetangX, to validate the efficacy of our proposed HinCRec-RL.

To tackle these issues, we propose a Pseudo-Siamese Network for multi-modal Entity Alignment (PSNEA). It consists of two modules to extract various information and generate holistic embeddings. Specifically, the first module PSN is designed with two parallel branches to learn the representations for different MMKGs, thus effectively bridging the graph heterogeneity. On top of this, we introduce an Incremental Alignment Pool (IAP) to alleviate the scarcity of initial seeds by labeling likely alignment. IAP avoids error-prone by data swapping and sample re-weighting strategies. To the best of our knowledge, PSNEA is the first model that tackles graph heterogeneity and scarcity of initial seeds in one unified framework.

Given that the knowledge graph has been proven to contain rich information, we present a novel framework that exploits the knowledge graph from various perspectives to address the above problems. As a preparation, the metadata is processed into a domain knowledge graph. A translate model for knowledge graph embedding is adopted to capture the relations between entities. Firstly we retrieve the relevant embedding from the knowledge graph by utilizing group relations in metadata and then integrate it with other modalities. Next, we introduce an Attention Teacher module for reliable attention allocation based on self-supervised learning. It learns the distribution of the knowledge graph and produces rational attention weights. Finally, a Genre-Centroid Anchored Contrastive Learning module is proposed to strengthen the discriminative ability of fused features.

In this paper, we propose TIVA-KG, a multimodal Knowledge Graph covering Text, Image, Video and Audio, which can benefit various downstream tasks. Our proposed TIVA-KG has two significant advantages over existing knowledge graphs in i) coverage of up to four modalities including text, image, video, audio, and ii) capability of triplet grounding which grounds multimodal relations to triples instead of entities. We further design a Quadruple Embedding Baseline (QEB) model to validate the necessity and efficacy of considering four modalities in KG. We conduct extensive experiments to test the proposed TIVA-KG with various knowledge graph representation approaches over link prediction task, demonstrating the benefits and necessity of introducing multiple modalities and triplet grounding.

A key challenge of knowledge-augmented VLP is the lack of clear connections between knowledge and multi-modal data. Moreover, not all knowledge present in images/texts is useful, therefore prior approaches often struggle to effectively integrate knowledge, visual, and textual information. In this study, we propose REtrieval-based knowledge Augmented Vision Language (REAVL), a novel knowledge-augmented pre-training framework to address the above issues. For the first time, we introduce a knowledge-aware self-supervised learning scheme that efficiently establishes the correspondence between knowledge and multi-modal data and identifies informative knowledge to improve the modeling of alignment and interactions between visual and textual modalities. By adaptively integrating informative knowledge with visual and textual information, REAVL achieves new state-of-the-art performance uniformly on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and multi-modal entity linking tasks, as well as competitive results on general vision-language tasks while only using 0.2% pre-training data of the best models.

This research is typically motivated by the argumentation that using such enhanced knowledge graphs to solve downstream tasks will improve performance. Nonetheless, this is hardly ever evaluated. Instead, the predominant evaluation metrics - aiming at correctness and completeness - are undoubtedly valuable but fail to capture the complete picture, i.e., how useful the created or enhanced knowledge graph actually is. Further, the accessibility of such a knowledge graph is rarely considered (e.g., whether it contains expressive labels, descriptions, and sufficient context information to link textual mentions to the entities of the knowledge graph). To better judge how well knowledge graphs perform on actual tasks, we present KGrEaT - a framework to estimate the quality of knowledge graphs via actual downstream tasks like classification, clustering, or recommendation. Instead of comparing different methods of processing knowledge graphs with respect to a single task, the purpose of KGrEaT is to compare various knowledge graphs as such by evaluating them on a fixed task setup. The framework takes a knowledge graph as input, automatically maps it to the datasets to be evaluated on, and computes performance metrics for the defined tasks.

In particular, we design a ""Quasi-Wasserstein'' distance between the observed multi-dimensional node labels and their estimations, optimizing the label transport defined on graph edges. The estimations are parameterized by a GNN in which the optimal label transport may determine the graph edge weights optionally. By reformulating the strict constraint of the label transport to a Bregman divergence-based regularizer, we obtain the proposed Quasi-Wasserstein loss associated with two efficient solvers learning the GNN together with optimal label transport. When predicting node labels, our model combines the output of the GNN with the residual component provided by the optimal label transport, leading to a new transductive prediction paradigm.

To bridge this gap, we investigate whether internet memes across social media platforms can be contextualized by using a semantic repository of knowledge, namely, a knowledge graph. We collect thousands of potential internet meme posts from two social media platforms, namely Reddit and Discord, and develop an extract-transform-load procedure to create a data lake with candidate meme posts. By using vision transformer-based similarity, we match these candidates against the memes cataloged in IMKG — a recently released knowledge graph of internet memes.

While recent advances in graph few shot learning achieve promising performance, they typically force to use a generic feature embedding across various tasks.

Developing methods to predict ESG ratings could alleviate such challenges, allow ESG ratings to be generated in a more timely manner, cover more companies, and be more accessible. Most works study the effects of ESG ratings on target variables such as stock prices or financial fundamentals of companies, but few works study how different types of company information can be utilized to predict ESG ratings.

In this paper, we focus on utilizing dynamic inter-company relationships for ESG ratings prediction, and examine the relative importance of different financial and dynamic network information in this prediction task.

This recently takes the form of knowledge graphs (KGs). The advent of new technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to improve automation in KE work due to the richness of their training data and their performance at solving natural language processing tasks.We conducted a multiple-methods study exploring user opinions and needs regarding the use of LLMs in KE.We used ethnographic techniques to observe KE workers using LLMs to solve KE tasks during a hackathon, followed by interviews with some of the participants. This interim study found that despite LLMs' promising capabilities for efficient knowledge acquisition and requirements elicitation, their effective deployment requires an extended set of capabilities and training, particularly in prompting and understanding data. LLMs can be useful for simple quality assessment tasks, but in complex scenarios, the output is hard to control and evaluation may require novel approaches. With this study, we aim to evidence the interaction of KE stakeholders with LLMs, identify areas of potential, and understand the barriers to their effective use.We find copilot approaches may be valuable in developing processes where the human or a team of humans is assisted by generative AI. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

Querying KGs is critical in web search, question answering (QA), semantic search, personal assistants, fact checking, and recommendation. While significant progress has been made on KG construction and curation, thanks to deep learning recently we have seen a surge of research on KG querying and QA. The objectives of our survey are two-fold. First, research on KG querying has been conducted by several communities, such as databases, data mining, semantic web, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing (NLP), with different focus and terminologies; and also in diverse topics ranging from graph databases, query languages, join algorithms, graph patterns matching, to more sophisticated KG embedding and natural language questions (NLQs). We aim at uniting different interdisciplinary topics and concepts that have been developed for KG querying. Second, many recent advances on KG and query embedding, multimodal KG, and KG-QA come from deep learning, IR, NLP, and computer vision domains. We identify important challenges of KG querying that received less attention by graph databases, and by the DB community in general, e.g., incomplete KG, semantic matching, multimodal data, and NLQs. We conclude by discussing interesting opportunities for the data management community, for instance, KG as a unified data model and vector-based query processing. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,Data mining; Deep learning; Directed graphs; Embeddings; Graph Databases; Information management; Knowledge graph; Query languages; Query processing; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Dbpedia; Directed edges; Graph database; Knowledge graphs; Language processing; Large-scales; Natural language questions; Natural languages; Question Answering; Real-world; Natural language processing systems,FALSE

However, manual fact-checking cannot keep up with the rate at which false information is generated and disseminated online. Automated fact-checking by machines is significantly quicker than by humans. But for better trust and transparency of these automated systems, explainability in the fact-checking process is necessary. Fact-checking often entails contrasting a factual assertion with a body of knowledge for such explanations. An effective way of representing knowledge is the Knowledge Graph (KG). There have been sufficient works proposed related to fact-checking with the usage of KG but not much focus is given to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in such cases. To mitigate this gap, we propose an RL-based KG reasoning approach for explainable fact-checking. Extensive experiments on FB15K-277 and NELL-995 datasets reveal that reasoning over a KG is an effective way of producing human-readable explanations in the form of paths and classifications for fact claims. The RL reasoning agent computes a path that either proves or disproves a factual claim, but does not provide a verdict itself. A verdict is reached by a voting mechanism that utilizes paths produced by the agent. These paths can be presented to human readers so that they themselves can decide whether or not the provided evidence is convincing or not. This work will encourage works in this direction for incorporating RL for explainable fact-checking as it increases trustworthiness by providing a human-in-the-loop approach. © 2023 ACM.",explainable AI; fact-checking; knowledge graph; misinformation detection; reinforcement learning,Automation; Classification (of information); Knowledge graph; Automated systems; Body of knowledge; Explainable AI; Fact-checking; Human-readable; Knowledge graphs; Misinformation detection; Reasoning approach; Reinforcement learnings; Voting mechanism; Reinforcement learning,FALSE

Although existing methods can learn good embeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal information, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is mainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and semantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately learning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations among different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the Evolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood subgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary chain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a Transformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We then craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while accomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the timeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to complete effective temporal information within the learned unified representation.

However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets.

However, their practical application is limited by issues such as poor generalization to new and unseen locations. Images are typically associated with diverse forms of context, which may exist in different modalities. In this work, we exploit the structured context linked to camera trap images to boost out-of-distribution generalization for species classification tasks in camera traps. For instance, a picture of a wild animal could be linked to details about the time and place it was captured, as well as structured biological knowledge about the animal species. While often overlooked by existing studies, incorporating such context offers several potential benefits for better image understanding, such as addressing data scarcity and enhancing generalization. However, effectively incorporating such heterogeneous context into the visual domain is a challenging problem. To address this, we propose a novel framework that transforms species classification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG). This framework enables the seamless integration of diverse multimodal contexts for visual recognition. We apply this framework for out-of-distribution species classification on the iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets and achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our framework enhances sample efficiency for recognizing under-represented species.  © 2024 ACM.",camera traps; KG link prediction; multimodal knowledge graph; species classification,Abiotic; Anthropogenic; Biotic; Invertebrates; Livestock; AS-links; Camera trap; Generalisation; Knowledge graph link prediction; Knowledge graphs; Link prediction; Multi-modal; Multimodal knowledge graph; Species classification; Knowledge graph,FALSE

This approach enhances the ability to distinguish similar entities over time, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal degradation. We introduce CYCLE: Cross-Year Contrastive Learning for Entity-Linking. This model employs a novel graph contrastive learning method to tackle temporal performance degradation in entity linking tasks. Our contrastive learning method treats newly added graph relationships as positive samples and newly removed ones as negative samples. This approach helps our model effectively prevent temporal degradation, achieving a 13.90% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art from 2023 when the time gap is one year, and a 17.79% improvement as the gap expands to three years.

Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those limitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain her/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Recently, there has been a rise of using knowledge graphs (KGs) for CRSs, where the core motivation is to incorporate the abundant side information carried by a KG into both the recommendation and conversation processes. However, existing KG-based CRSs are subject to two defects: (1) there is a semantic gap between the learned representations of utterances and KG entities, hindering the retrieval of relevant KG information; (2) the reasoning over KG is mostly performed with the implicitly learned user interests, overlooking the explicit signals from the entities actually mentioned in the conversation. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new CRS framework, namely, the Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) model. As a user can reflect her/his preferences via both attribute- and item-level expressions, KECR jointly embeds the structured knowledge from two levels in the KG. A mutual information maximization constraint is further proposed for semantic alignment between the embedding spaces of utterances and KG entities. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity within the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the model less dependent on the user’s feedback to clarifying questions. As such, the semantic alignment and explicit KG reasoning can jointly facilitate accurate recommendation and quality dialogue generation. By comparing with strong baselines on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KECR obtains state-of-the-art recommendation effectiveness, as well as competitive dialogue generation performance. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The infringement examples of pirated videos are not limited to simple piracy or watermarking and other easily identifiable ways. The existing traditional methods mainly distinguish whether the video is copied by comparing the similarity of the video in the database. However, for video editing with large spatial and temporal differences, the cost of pixel-level comparison is huge, and the robustness of copy detection is also difficult to guarantee. Even the latest network learning methods still need to rely on enough training data and the generalization ability is poor. Aiming at the above issues, we propose a novel “coarse to fine” video copy accurate detection framework. In order to improve the detection efficiency of massive video frames, we first construct semantic graph for all key frames between source and target videos in the coarse detection stage. The pixel matching problem is transformed into graph structure matching to roughly divide the instances that may be copied, which significantly reduces the search range of subsequent video frames and improves the search speed. In the fine detection stage, we innovatively applied the cross-self-attention to video frame copy detection. By strengthening the contextual links between pixels in the keyframe space under the constraints of semantic mapping with the method of self-attention, global features are constructed by obtaining features common between the source video and the copy video through cross-attention to achieve the similarity measure between video frames in the high-dimensional space. Finally, based on the obtained global features, we perform an accurate and fast comparison through the hash segmentation method to achieve fast and high-precision video copy fine detection. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing state-of-arts our method has extremely high detection robustness against all mainstream video tampering results, and has the highest detection efficiency even in massive videos. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Hash Dicing; Knowledge Graph; Video Copy Detection,Efficiency; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Semantics; Video signal processing; Copy detection; Detection efficiency; Hash dicing; Key-frames; Knowledge graphs; Semantic graphs; Video copies; Video copy detection; Video editing; Video frame; Pixels,FALSE

In this survey, we discuss how knowledge about completeness, recall, and negation in KBs can be expressed, extracted, and inferred. We cover (i) the logical foundations of knowledge representation and querying under partial closed-world semantics; (ii) the estimation of this information via statistical patterns; (iii) the extraction of information about recall from KBs and text; (iv) the identification of interesting negative statements; and (v) relaxed notions of relative recall.

The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g., purchasing an item) allow to capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used as auxiliary information (e.g., page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours; (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviours where the information in the auxiliary behaviours might be non-relevant for recommendation. In this case, a direct adoption of contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a dual-perspective knowledge encoding component that enriches the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance recommendation. In addition, we develop a cross-behaviour learning component, which includes two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms seven existing state-of-the-art methods.

Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) algebraic perspective, (2) geometric perspective and (3) analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties.

Existing MNER studies fall short in that they merely focus on extracting text-based entity-type pairs, often leading to entity ambiguities and failing to contribute to multimodal knowledge graph construction. In the GMNER task, the objective becomes more challenging: identifying named entities in text, determining their entity types, and locating their corresponding bounding boxes in linked images, necessitating precise alignment between the textual and visual information. We introduce a novel multi-level alignment pre-training method, engaging with both text-image and entity-object dimensions to foster deeper congruence between multimodal data. Specifically, we innovatively harness potential objects identified within images, aligning them with textual entity prompts, thereby generating refined soft pseudo-labels. These labels serve as self-supervised signals that pre-train the model to more accurately extract entities from textual input. To address misalignments that often plague modality integration, our method employs a sophisticated diffusion model that performs back-translation on the text to generate a corresponding visual representation, thus refining the model’s multimodal interpretative accuracy. Empirical evidence from the GMNER dataset validates that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the versatility of our pre-training process complements virtually all extant models, offering an additional avenue for augmenting their multimodal entity recognition acumen. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Contrastive learning; Multimodal named entity recognition; Vision-Language Pretraining Models,Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Contrastive learning; Entity-types; Graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Multi-modal; Multilevels; Multimodal named entity recognition; Named entity recognition; Pre-training; Vision-language pretraining model; Alignment,FALSE

In this regard, we propose an end-to-end framework: a Knowledge-Driven approach to enhance Topic Modeling called KDTM that incorporates fine-grained knowledge fusion for topic modeling. Specifically, we adopt a dual-stream structure where a pre-trained language model and an image model are parallelly combined to construct a multi-modal model. We then enhance the structured representation by integrating fine-grained scene graph knowledge through a knowledge-enhanced encoder, which is constructed based on the scene graph. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we significantly improve topic quality (such as coherence and diversity) using the aforementioned approach.

Currently, research efforts are directed towards the development of sophisticated deep learning models, such as graph neural networks, that can effectively capture and integrate the multi-modal features of entities for entity alignment tasks. While these models have shown promising results, they tend to focus on capturing only the local structure of entities, leading to the challenge of subgraph isomorphism. Moreover, the complexity of these models often hinders their scalability.

However, the human sensory system is inherently multi-modal, as objects around us are often represented by a combination of multiple signals, such as visual and textual. Consequently, Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which combine structured knowledge representation with multiple modalities, represent a powerful extension of KGs. Although MMKGs can handle certain types of tasks (e.g., visual query answering) or queries that standard KGs cannot process, and they can effectively tackle some standard problems (e.g., entity alignment), we lack a widely accepted definition of MMKG.

To better organize them, Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), comprising the structural triplets of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) together with entity-related multimodal data (e.g., images and texts), have been introduced consecutively. However, it is still a great challenge to explore MKGs due to their inherent incompleteness. Although most existing Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) approaches can infer missing triplets based on available factual triplets and multimodal information, they almost ignore the modal conflicts and supervisory effect, failing to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Knowledge Alignment (HKA) framework for MKGC. Specifically, a macro-knowledge alignment module is proposed to capture global semantic relevance between modalities for dealing with modal conflicts in MKG. Furthermore, a micro-knowledge alignment module is also developed to reveal the local consistency information through inter- and intra-modality supervisory effects more effectively. By integrating different modal predictions, a final decision can be made.

However, the existing representation methods of environmental information mostly emphasize the concepts and relationships in the environment and have an insufficient understanding of the items and relationships at the instance level. There are also some problems such as low visualization of knowledge representation, poor human-machine interaction ability, insufficient knowledge reasoning ability, and slow knowledge search speed, which cannot meet the needs of intelligent and personalized service. Based on this, this paper designs a cognitive information representation model based on a knowledge graph, which combines the perceptual information of industrial robot ontology with semantic description information such as functional attributes obtained from the Internet to form a structured and logically reasoned cognitive knowledge graph including perception layer and cognition layer. Aiming at the problem that the data sources of the knowledge base for constructing the cognitive knowledge graph are wide and heterogeneous, and there are entity semantic differences and knowledge system differences among different data sources, a multimodal entity semantic fusion model based on vector features and a system fusion framework based on HowNet are designed, and the environment description information such as object semantics, attributes, relations, spatial location, and context acquired by industrial robots and their own state information are unified and standardized. The automatic representation of robot perceived information is realized, and the universality, systematicness, and intuition of robot cognitive information representation are enhanced, so that the cognition reasoning ability and knowledge retrieval efficiency of robots in the industrial Internet environment can be effectively improved.  © 2020 Dong Zhong et al.",,Industrial robots; Knowledge based systems; Machine design; Search engines; Semantic Web; Semantics; Cognitive information; Description information; Environmental information; Human machine interaction; Perceptual information; Representation method; Semantic descriptions; Visualization of knowledge; Knowledge representation,FALSE

This method uses knowledge graphs to store and model items in the scene in the form of images, videos, texts, and other multimodal forms.

Current entity ambiguity elimination methods usually use the context information of the entity and its attributes to obtain the mention embedding vector, compare it with the candidate entity embedding vector for similarity, and perform entity matching through the similarity. The disadvantage of this type of method is that it ignores the structural characteristics of the knowledge graph where the entity is located, that is, the connection between the entity and the entity, and therefore cannot obtain the global semantic features of the entity. To improve the Precision and Recall of entity disambiguation problems, we propose the EDEGE (Entity Disambiguation based on Entity and Graph Embedding) method, which utilizes the semantic embedding vector of entity relationship and the embedding vector of subgraph structure feature. EDEGE first trains the semantic vector of the entity relationship, then trains the graph structure vector of the subgraph where the entity is located, and balances the weights of these two vectors through the entity similarity function. Finally, the balanced vector is input into the graph neural network, and the matching between the entities is output to achieve entity disambiguation. Extensive experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Such relationships have become one prominent component of knowledge within sparse image data collected by multimedia sensing devices. Both the latent information and potential privacy can be included in the relationships. However, due to the high combinatorial complexity in modeling all potential relation triplets, previous studies on visual relationship detection have used the mixed visual and semantic features separately for each object, which is incapable for sparse data in IoT systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new deep learning model for visual relationship detection, which is a novel attempt for cooperating computational intelligence (CI) methods with IoTs. The model imports the knowledge graph and adopts features for both entities and connections among them as extra information. It maps the visual features extracted from images into the knowledge-based embedding vector space, so as to benefit from information in the background knowledge domain and alleviate the impacts of data sparsity. This is the first time that visual features are projected and combined with prior knowledge for visual relationship detection. Moreover, the complexity of the network is reduced by avoiding the learning of redundant features from images. Finally, we show the superiority of our model by evaluating on two datasets.  © 2021 Yang He et al.",,Complex networks; Deep learning; Intelligent computing; Internet of things; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Vector spaces; Back-ground knowledge; Combinatorial complexity; Knowledge based; Knowledge graphs; Latent information; Learning models; Redundant features; Semantic features; Feature extraction,FALSE

Fine-grained image classification focuses on recognizing subcategories of specific levels of images. As a result of the high similarity between images in the same category and the high dissimilarity in the same subcategories, it has always been a challenging problem in computer vision. Traditional approaches usually rely on exploring only the visual information in images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Knowledge Graph Representation Fusion (KGRF) framework to introduce prior knowledge into fine-grained image classification task. Specifically, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) is employed to learn the knowledge representation from the constructed knowledge graph modeling the categories-subcategories and subcategories-attributes associations. By introducing the Multimodal Compact Bilinear (MCB) module, the framework can fully integrate the knowledge representation and visual features for learning the high-level image features.

First, our system extracts semantic relationships and key features by knowledge graph and statistical analysis. Then, IoT network requests are converted into word vectors through multiview feature fusion and feature alignment. Finally, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model is designed to identify malicious request attacks, which can capture long-distance dependence and contextual semantic information. Experiment results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing solution in the robustness of the model.

Compared with other retrieval models based on concept dictionaries or concept networks, the retrieval model based on LSA has the advantages of strong computability and less human participation. LSA establishes a latent semantic space through truncated singular value decomposition. Words and documents in the latent semantic space are projected onto the dimension representing the latent concept, and then the semantic relationship between words can be extracted to present the semantic structure in natural language. This paper designs the system architecture of the public prosecutorial knowledge graph. Combining the graph data storage technology and the characteristics of the public domain ontology, a knowledge graph storage method is designed. By building a prototype system, the functions of knowledge management, knowledge query, and knowledge push are realized. A named entity recognition method based on bidirectional long-short-term memory (bi-LSTM) combined with conditional random field (CRF) is proposed. Bi-LSTM-CRF performs named entity recognition based on character-level features. CRF can use the transition matrix to further obtain the relationship between each position label, so that bi-LSTM-CRF not only retains the context information but also considers the influence between the current position and the previous position. The experimental results show that the LSTM-entity-context method proposed in this paper improves the representation ability of text semantics compared with other algorithms. However, this method only introduces relevant entity information to supplement the semantic representation of the text. The order in the case is often ignored, especially when it comes to the time series of the case characteristics, and the ""order problem""may eventually affect the final prediction result. The knowledge graph of legal documents of theft cases based on ontology can be updated and maintained in real time.

Scholars can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by guiding the actions of practitioners based on the analysis of SDG data, as intended by this work. We propose a framework of algorithms based on dimensionality reduction methods with the use of Hilbert Space Filling Curves (HSFCs) in order to semantically cluster new uncategorised SDG data and novel indicators, and efficiently place them in the environment of a distributed knowledge graph store. First, a framework of algorithms for insertion of new indicators and projection on the HSFC curve based on their transformer-based similarity assessment, for retrieval of indicators and load-balancing along with an approach for data classification of entrant-indicators is described.

Thus, it is crucial to comprehend the PPIs thoroughly such that we are able to illuminate the disease occurrence, achieve the optimal drug-target therapeutic effect and describe the protein complex structures. However, compared to the protein sequences obtainable from various species and organisms, the number of revealed protein-protein interactions is relatively limited. To address this dilemma, lots of research endeavor have investigated in it to facilitate the discovery of novel PPIs. Among these methods, PPI prediction techniques that merely rely on protein sequence data are more widespread than other methods which require extensive biological domain knowledge. Results: In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep representation learning structure by incorporating protein physicochemical features with the graph topological features from the PPI networks. Specifically, our method not only bears in mind the protein sequence information but also discerns the topological representations for each protein node in the PPI networks. In our paper, we construct a stacked auto-encoder architecture together with a continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model based on generated metapaths to study the PPI predictions. Following by that, we utilize the supervised deep neural networks to identify the PPIs and classify the protein families. The PPI prediction accuracy for eight species ranged from 96.76% to 99.77%, which signifies that our multi-modal deep representation learning framework achieves superior performance compared to other computational methods.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a joint continual learning biomedical information extraction (JCBIE) network to extract entities and relations from different biomedical information datasets. By empirically studying different joint learning and continual learning strategies, the proposed JCBIE can learn and expand different types of entities and relations from different datasets. JCBIE uses two separated encoders in joint-feature extraction, hence can effectively avoid the feature confusion problem comparing with using one hard-parameter sharing encoder. Specifically, it allows us to adopt entity augmented inputs to establish the interaction between named entity recognition and relation extraction. Finally, a novel evaluation mechanism is proposed for measuring cross-corpus generalization errors, which was ignored by traditional evaluation methods.

For developing computational medication recommendation methods based on EMR, an important challenge is the lack of a large number of longitudinal EMR data with time correlation. Faced with this challenge, this paper proposes a new EMR-based medication recommendation model called MR-KPA, which combines knowledge-enhanced pre-training with the deep adversarial network to improve medication recommendation from both feature representation and the fine-tuning process. Firstly, a knowledge-enhanced pre-training visit model is proposed to realize domain knowledge-based external feature fusion and pre-training-based internal feature mining for improving the feature representation. Secondly, a medication recommendation model based on the deep adversarial network is developed to optimize the fine-tuning process of pre-training visit model and alleviate over-fitting of model caused by the task gap between pre-training and recommendation. Result: The experimental results on EMRs from medical and health institutions in Hainan Province, China show that the proposed MR-KPA model can effectively improve the accuracy of medication recommendation on small-scale longitudinal EMR data compared with existing representative methods. Conclusion: The advantages of the proposed MR-KPA are mainly attributed to knowledge enhancement based on ontology embedding, the pre-training visit model and adversarial training. Each of these three optimizations is very effective for improving the capability of medication recommendation on small-scale longitudinal EMR data, and the pre-training visit model has the most significant improvement effect. These three optimizations are also complementary, and their integration makes the proposed MR-KPA model achieve the best recommendation effect. © 2022, The Author(s).",Adversarial training; Electronic medical record; Graph attention network; Medication recommendation; Pre-training model,Domain Knowledge; E-learning; Medical computing; Recommender systems; Adversarial networks; Adversarial training; Electronic medical record; Feature representation; Graph attention network; Medical record; Medication recommendation; Pre-training; Pre-training model; Training model; article; attention network; China; electronic medical record; embedding; human; low drug dose; mining; ontology; Tuning,FALSE

Method: We develop a text classification algorithm that represents a document as a combination of a ""bag of words"" and a ""bag of knowledge terms,"" where a ""knowledge term"" is a term shared between the document and the subgraph of KG relevant to the disease classification task. We use two Chinese disease diagnosis corpora to evaluate the algorithm. The first one, HaoDaiFu, contains 51,374 chief complaints categorized into 805 diseases. The second data set, ChinaRe, contains 86,663 patient descriptions categorized into 44 disease categories. Results: On the two evaluation data sets, the proposed algorithm delivers robust performance and outperforms a wide range of baselines, including resampling, deep learning, and feature selection approaches. Both classification-based metric (macro-averaged F 1 score) and ranking-based metric (mean reciprocal rank) are used in evaluation. Conclusion: Medical knowledge in large-scale knowledge graphs can be effectively leveraged to improve rare diseases classification models, even when the knowledge graph is incomplete. © 2019 The Author(s).",Extremely imbalanced data; Knowledge graph; Machine learning; Rare disease diagnosis; Text classification,"Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Rare Diseases; Triage; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; classification; emergency health service; human; machine learning; rare disease",FALSE

Diverging from traditional text matching, the knowledge spectrum graph transforms information acquisition in search engines. This paper pioneers a predictive system for delineating the relationship between educational psychology and ideological and political education in universities. Initially, it extracts diverse psychological mapping relationships of students, constructing a knowledge graph. By employing the KNN algorithm, the system analyzes psychological characteristics to effectively forecast the relationship between educational psychology and ideological and political education in universities. The system's functionality is meticulously detailed in this paper, and its performance is rigorously tested. The results demonstrate high accuracy, recall rates, and F1 values.

However, with rapid development in weaving technology, ever-changing market demands, and shifting public aesthetics, Nanjing Yunjin, as an intangible cultural heritage, faces the challenge of survival and inheritance. Addressing this issue requires efficient storage, management, and utilization of Yunjin knowledge to enhance public understanding and recognition of Yunjin culture. In this study, we have constructed an intelligent question-answering system for Nanjing Yunjin digital resources based on knowledge graph, utilizing the Neo4j graph database for efficient organization, storage, and protection of Nanjing Yunjin knowledge, thereby revealing its profound cultural connotations. Furthermore, we adopted deep learning algorithms for natural language parsing. Specifically, we adopted BERT-based intent recognition technology to categorize user queries by intent, and we employed the BERT + BiGRU + CRF model for entity recognition. By comparing with BERT + BILSTM + CRF, BERT + CRF and BILSTM + CRF models, our model demonstrated superior performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, substantiating the superiority and effectiveness of this model. Finally, based on the parsed results of the question, we constructed knowledge graph query statements, executed by the Cypher language, and the processed query results were fed back to the users in natural language. Through system implementation and testing, multiple indices including system response time, stability, load condition, accuracy, and scalability were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the Nanjing Yunjin intelligent question-answering system, built on the knowledge graph, is able to efficiently and accurately generate answers to user’s natural language queries, greatly facilitating the retrieval and utilization of Yunjin knowledge. This not only reinforces the transmission, promotion, and application of Yunjin culture but also provides a paradigm for constructing other intangible cultural heritage question-answering systems based on knowledge graphs. This has substantial theoretical and practical significance for deeply exploring and uncovering the knowledge structure of human intangible heritage, promoting cultural inheritance and protection. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Information retrieval; Intangible cultural heritage; Knowledge graph; Nanjing Yunjin; Question-answering system,,FALSE

The semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes poses challenges for individuals without expertise in cultural heritage due to gaps in domain knowledge and discrepancies in understanding. However, the existing domain ontology and knowledge graph provide an insufficient representation of the knowledge of Chinese grottoes. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a knowledge graph representation method to provide explicit knowledge for participants at different stages of semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes, which includes schema layer construction and data layer construction. On the schema layer, we design a domain ontology named ChgOnto (Chinese Grottoes Ontology) that consists of four high-level concept classes: spatial object, informational object, digital device, and temporal object. Among the classes in the ChgOnto, the components (e.g., cliff wall, cave roof, cliff wall footing), elements (e.g., primary Buddha statue, pedestal, decoration), the properties (e.g., length, width, depth) of caves and niches in Chinese grottoes as well as the spatial relationships between them are all precisely defined. ChgOnto also reuse the classes from the renowned CIDOC CRM ontology in the cultural heritage field and GeoSPARQL in the geospatial domain, facilitating integration between the two subjects. Considering the schema layer as the conceptual data model, the data layer extracts knowledge from unstructured text through natural language processing tools to instantiate the abstract classes and fill the properties of the schema layer. Finally, the knowledge required for semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes is expressed in the data layer by a knowledge graph in a fixed expression form. Dazu Rock Carvings, a World Heritage site in China, is selected as a case study to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that our method offers a robust knowledge-sharing platform for the semantic 3D modeling of Chinese grottoes and demonstrates excellent scalability.

The protection and inheritance of these precious cultural resources has become a critical task. This paper focuses on the Miao batik culture in Guizhou Province, China, and explores the application of knowledge graphs, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques in the promotion and protection of batik culture. We propose a dual-channel mechanism that integrates semantic and visual information, aiming to connect batik pattern features with cultural connotations. First, we use natural language processing techniques to automatically extract batik-related entities and relationships from the literature, and construct and visualize a structured batik pattern knowledge graph. Based on this knowledge graph, users can textually search and understand the images, meanings, taboos, and other cultural information of specific patterns. Second, for the batik pattern classification, we propose an improved ResNet34 model. By embedding average pooling and convolutional operations into the residual blocks and introducing long-range residual connections, the classification performance is enhanced. By inputting pattern images into this model, their categories can be accurately identified, and then the underlying cultural connotations can be understood. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other mainstream models in evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving 94.46%, 94.47%, 93.62%, and 93.8%, respectively.

The automatic detection of rumor from posts has emerged as a major concern for the general public, the government, and social media platforms. Most existing methods focus on the linguistic and semantic aspects of posts content, while ignoring knowledge entities and concepts hidden within the article which facilitate rumor detection. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end attention and graph-based neural network model (KAGN), which incorporates external knowledge from the knowledge graphs to detect rumor. Specifically, given the post's sparse and ambiguous semantics, we identify entity mentions in the post’s content and link them to entities and concepts in the knowledge graphs, which serve as complementary semantic information for the post text. To effectively inject external knowledge into textual representations, we develop a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to fuse local knowledge. Additionally, we construct a graph consisting of posts texts, entities, and concepts, which is fed to graph convolutional networks to explore long-range knowledge through graph structure. Our proposed model can therefore detect rumor by combining semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of posts. Extensive experiments on four publicly available real-world datasets show that KAGN outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, and also validate the effectiveness of knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s).",Attention; Graph convolutional networks; Knowledge graphs; Rumor detection; Social media,Convolution; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Social networking (online); Attention; Automatic Detection; Convolutional networks; External knowledge; Graph convolutional network; Knowledge graphs; Online medium; Rumor detection; Social media; Social media platforms; Semantics,FALSE

In the coming years, it is expected to spread rapidly, with limited progress in diagnostic techniques. Various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been employed to detect AD using single-modality data. However, recent developments in ML have enabled the application of these methods to multiple data sources and input modalities for AD prediction. In this study, we developed a framework that utilizes multimodal data (tabular data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, and genetic information) to classify AD. As part of the pre-processing phase, we generated a knowledge graph from the tabular data and MRI images. We employed graph neural networks for knowledge graph creation, and region-based convolutional neural network approach for image-to-knowledge graph generation. Additionally, we integrated various explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret and elucidate the prediction outcomes derived from multimodal data. Layer-wise relevance propagation was used to explain the layer-wise outcomes in the MRI images. We also incorporated submodular pick local interpretable model-agnostic explanations to interpret the decision-making process based on the tabular data provided. Genetic expression values play a crucial role in AD analysis. We used a graphical gene tree to identify genes associated with the disease.

They have demonstrated significant early promise over other methods of biological data representation, such as in target discovery, side effect prediction and drug repurposing. In parallel, an explosion of -omics data for the deep characterization of biological systems routinely uncovers molecular signatures of disease for similar applications. Here, we present RPath, a novel algorithm that prioritizes drugs for a given disease by reasoning over causal paths in a knowledge graph (KG), guided by both drug-perturbed as well as disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. First, our approach identifies the causal paths that connect a drug to a particular disease. Next, it reasons over these paths to identify those that correlate with the transcriptional signatures observed in a drug-perturbation experiment, and anti-correlate to signatures observed in the disease of interest. The paths which match this signature profile are then proposed to represent the mechanism of action of the drug. We demonstrate how RPath consistently prioritizes clinically investigated drug-disease pairs on multiple datasets and KGs, achieving better performance over other similar methodologies. Furthermore, we present two case studies showing how one can deconvolute the predictions made by RPath as well as predict novel targets.  © 2022 Domingo-Ferna'ndez et al.

However, existing experimental methods for identifying new targets are generally labor-intensive and failure-prone. On the other hand, computational approaches, especially the machine learning-based frameworks, have shown remarkable application potential in drug discovery. In this work, we propose Progeni, a novel machine learning-based framework for target identification. In addition to fully exploiting the known heterogeneous biological networks from various sources, Progeni integrates literature evidence about the relations between biological entities to construct a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph neural networks are then employed in Progeni to learn the feature embeddings of biological entities to facilitate the identification of biologically relevant target candidates. A comprehensive evaluation of Progeni demonstrated its superior predictive power over the baseline methods on the target identification task. In addition, our extensive tests showed that Progeni exhibited high robustness to the negative effect of exposure bias, a common phenomenon in recommendation systems, and effectively identified new targets that can be strongly supported by the literature. Moreover, our wet lab experiments successfully validated the biological significance of the top target candidates predicted by Progeni for melanoma and colorectal cancer. All these results suggested that Progeni can identify biologically effective targets and thus provide a powerful and useful tool for advancing the drug discovery process. Copyright: © 2024 Liu et al.

Comprehending prose text simply from the available text is particularly challenging as in general the comprehension of prose requires the use of external knowledge or references.

This paper has proposed a comprehension engine consisting of knowledge induction which connects the knowledge space by augmenting associations within it. The connections are achieved through the automatic incremental reading of external references and the capturing of high familiarity knowledge associations between prose concepts. The Ontology Engine is used to find lexical knowledge associations amongst concept pairs, with the objective being to obtain a knowledge space graph with a single giant component to establish a base model for prose comprehension. The comprehension engine is evaluated through experiments with various selected prose texts. Akin to human readers, it could mine reference texts from modern knowledge corpuses such as Wikipedia and WordNet. The results demonstrate the potential efficiency of using the comprehension engine that enhances the quality of reading comprehension in addition to reducing reading time.

However, the textual information is not fully exploited, overlooking the wide background knowledge available for Web images. This work proposes a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) to represent the knowledge extracted from unstructured Web image surrounding text and to integrate the relationship between image and text entities. Existing multimodal KG works have mainly focused on advanced visual processes for extracting entities and relations from images, and only employed standard text processing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging to capture nouns only or basic subject-verb-object from text in the semantic enrichment process. Adversely, neglecting other rich information in the text. Thus, the proposed approach attempts to address this as an automatic relation extraction (RE) problem to extract all possible triples from the text information from simple to complex sentences, in constructing the multimodal KG which eventually can be used as a training seed for visual tasks. A linguistic analysis is performed on a set of Web news articles consisting of news images and their related text. The dependency relations and POS information obtained are used to formulate a set of domain-agnostic entity-relation extraction rules. A triple extractor incorporating these rules, is developed to extract the triples from a news articles dataset and construct the proposed MKG. The Precision and Recall metrics are used to evaluate the extractor’s performance. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can extract entities and relations in the dataset with the precision score of 0.90 and recall score of 0.60.

Although previous studies validate that LLMs perform well on general knowledge while presenting poor performance on long-tail nuanced knowledge, the community is still doubtful about whether the traditional knowledge graphs should be replaced by LLMs. In this paper, we ask if the schema of knowledge graph (i.e., taxonomy) is made obsolete by LLMs. Intuitively, LLMs should perform well on common taxonomies and at taxonomy levels that are common to people. Unfortunately, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over a wide range of taxonomies from common to specialized domains and at levels from root to leaf so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To narrow the research gap, we constructed a novel taxonomy hierarchical structure discovery benchmark named TaxoGlimpse to evaluate the performance of LLMs over taxonomies. TaxoGlimpse covers ten representative taxonomies from common to specialized domains with in-depth experiments of different levels of entities in this taxonomy from root to leaf. Our comprehensive experiments of eighteen LLMs under three prompting settings validate that LLMs perform miserably poorly in handling specialized taxonomies and leaf-level entities. Specifically, the QA accuracy of the best LLM drops by up to 30% as we go from common to specialized domains and from root to leaf levels of taxonomies. © 2024, VLDB Endowment.

Multimedia is a useful resource that people understand complex situations such as the elderly care domain. Appropriate annotation is beneficial in several tasks of information management, such as storing, retrieval, and summarization of data, from a semantic perspective. However, the metadata annotation for multimedia data remains problematic because metadata is obtained as a result of interpretation depending on domain-specific knowledge, and it needs well-controlled and comprehensive vocabulary for annotation. In this study, we proposed a collaborative methodology for developing ontologies and annotation with domain experts. The method includes (1) classification of knowledge types for collaborative construction of annotation data, (2) division of tasks among a team composed of domain experts, ontology engineers, and annotators, and (3) incremental approach to ontology development. We applied the proposed method to 11 videos on elderly care domain for the confirmation of its feasibility. We focused on annotation of actions occurring in these videos, thereby the annotated data is used as a support in evaluating staff skills. The application results show the content in the ontology during annotation increases monotonically. The number of “action concepts” is saturated and reused among the case studies. This demonstrates that the ontology is reusable and could represent various case studies by using a small number of “action concepts”. This study concludes by presenting lessons learnt from the case studies.

Existing methods for CSC mostly utilize BERT models, which select a character from a candidate list to correct errors in the sentence. World knowledge refers to structured information and relationships spanning a wide range of domains and subjects, while definition knowledge pertains to textual explanations or descriptions of specific words or concepts. Both forms of knowledge have the potential to enhance a model’s ability to comprehend contextual nuances. As BERT lacks sufficient guidance from world knowledge for error correction and existing models overlook the rich definition knowledge in Chinese dictionaries, the performance of spelling correction models is somewhat compromised. To address these issues, within the world knowledge network, this study injects world knowledge from knowledge graphs into the model to assist in correcting spelling errors caused by a lack of world knowledge. Additionally, the definition knowledge network in this model improves the error correction capability by utilizing the definitions from the Chinese dictionary through a comparative learning approach. Experimental results on the SIGHAN benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Commonsense knowledge graphs use free-form text to represent nodes, resulting in orders of magnitude more nodes compared to conventional KBs (∼18x more nodes in ATOMIC compared to Freebase (FB15K-237)). Importantly, this implies significantly sparser graph structures — a major challenge for existing KB completion methods that assume densely connected graphs over a relatively smaller set of nodes. In this paper, we present novel KB completion models that can address these challenges by exploiting the structural and semantic context of nodes. Specifically, we investigate two key ideas: (1) learning from local graph structure, using graph convolutional networks and automatic graph densification and (2) transfer learning from pre-trained language models to knowledge graphs for enhanced contextual representation of knowledge. We describe our method to incorporate information from both these sources in a joint model and provide the first empirical results for KB completion on ATOMIC and evaluation with ranking metrics on ConceptNet. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of language model representations in boosting link prediction performance and the advantages of learning from local graph structure (+1.5 points in MRR for ConceptNet) when training on subgraphs for computational efficiency. Further analysis on model predictions shines light on the types of commonsense knowledge that language models capture well.

To this end, we propose a novel Dual-Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks, termed as DDGCN, which can model the dynamics of messages in propagation as well as the dynamics of the background knowledge from Knowledge graphs in one unified framework. Specifically, two Graph Convolutional Networks are adopted to capture the above two types of structure information at different time stages, which are then combined with a temporal fusing unit. This allows for learning the dynamic event representations in a more fine-grained manner, and incrementally aggregating them to capture the cascading effect for better rumor detection. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposal yields significant improvements compared to strong baselines and can detect rumors at early stages.

Besides, the current MNER and MRE models only consider aligning the visual objects with textual entities in visual and textual graphs but ignore the entity-entity relationships and object-object relationships. To address the above challenges, we propose an edge-enhanced graph alignment network and a word-pair relation tagging (EEGA) for the JMERE task.

Then, we propose an edge-enhanced graph alignment network to enhance the JMERE task by aligning nodes and edges in the cross-graph.

In recent years, several network-based techniques have emerged for predicting DDIs. However, they primarily focus on local structures within DDI-related networks, often overlooking the significance of indirect connections between pairwise drug nodes from a global perspective. Additionally, effectively handling heterogeneous information present in both biomedical knowledge graphs and drug molecular graphs remains a challenge for improved performance of DDI prediction. To address these limitations, we propose a Transformer-based relatIon-aware Graph rEpresentation leaRning framework (TIGER) for DDI prediction. TIGER leverages the Transformer architecture to effectively exploit the structure of heterogeneous graph, which allows it direct learning of long dependencies and high-order structures. Furthermore, TIGER incorporates a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, capturing a diverse range of semantic relations that exist between pairs of nodes in heterogeneous graph. In addition to these advancements, TIGER enhances predictive accuracy by modeling DDI prediction task using a dual-channel network, where drug molecular graph and biomedical knowledge graph are fed into two respective channels. By incorporating embeddings obtained at graph and node levels, TIGER can benefit from structural properties of drugs as well as rich contextual information provided by biomedical knowledge graph. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TIGER in DDI prediction. Furthermore, case studies highlight its ability to provide a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms of DDIs.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-grained multi-modal knowledge graph contrastive hashing method for cross-modal search (CMGCH). Firstly, in order to capture implicit fine-grained cross-modal semantic associations, a multi-modal knowledge graph is constructed, which represents the implicit multimodal knowledge relations between the image and text as inter-modal and intra-modal semantic associations. Secondly, a cross-modal graph contrastive attention network is proposed to reason on the multi-modal knowledge graph to sufficiently learn the implicit fine-grained inter-modal and intra-modal knowledge relations. Thirdly, a cross-modal multi-granularity contrastive embedding learning mechanism is proposed, which fuses the global coarse-grained and local fine-grained embeddings by multihead attention mechanism for inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive learning, so as to enhance the cross-modal unified representations with stronger discriminativeness and semantic consistency preserving power. With the joint training of intra-modal and inter-modal contrast, the invariant and modal-specific information of different modalities can be maintained in the final cross-modal unified hash space. Extensive experiments on several cross-modal benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CMGCH outperforms the state-of the-art methods.

Conventional methods generally focus on capturing the linguistic and visual semantics within the multimodal content, which fall short in effectively distinguishing the heightened level of meticulous fabrications. Recently, external knowledge is introduced to provide valuable background facts as complementary to facilitate news detection. Nevertheless, existing knowledge-enhanced endeavors directly incorporate all knowledge contexts through static entity embeddings, resulting in the potential noisy and content-irrelevant knowledge. Moreover, the integration of knowledge entities makes it intractable to model the sophisticated correlations between multimodal semantics and knowledge entities. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel Adaptive Knowledge-Aware Fake News Detection model, dubbed AKA-Fake. For each news, AKA-Fake learns a compact knowledge subgraph under a reinforcement learning paradigm, which consists of a subset of entities and contextual neighbors in the knowledge graph, restoring the most informative knowledge facts. A novel heterogeneous graph learning module is further proposed to capture the reliable cross-modality correlations via topology refinement and modality-attentive pooling. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over three popular datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AKA-Fake.

However, existing methods suffer from shortcomings, including modality impurity such as noise in raw image and ambiguous textual entity representation, which puts obstacles to MEL. We formulate multimodal entity linking as a neural text matching problem where each multimodal information (text and image) is treated as a query, and the model learns the mapping from each query to the relevant entity from candidate entities. This paper introduces a dual-way enhanced (DWE) framework for MEL: (1) our model refines queries with multimodal data and addresses semantic gaps using cross-modal enhancers between text and image information. Besides, DWE innovatively leverages fine-grained image attributes, including facial characteristic and scene feature, to enhance and refine visual features. (2)By using Wikipedia descriptions, DWE enriches entity semantics and obtains more comprehensive textual representation, which reduces between textual representation and the entities in KG.

However, the large number of parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However, traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7% compared to the baseline.

To address this issue, the continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) task has been proposed to train the KGE model by learning emerging knowledge efficiently while simultaneously preserving decent old knowledge. However, the explicit graph structure in KGs, which is critical for the above goal, has been heavily ignored by existing CKGE methods. On the one hand, existing methods usually learn new triples in a random order, destroying the inner structure of new KGs. On the other hand, old triples are preserved with equal priority, failing to alleviate catastrophic forgetting effectively. In this paper, we propose a competitive method for CKGE based on incremental distillation (IncDE), which considers the full use of the explicit graph structure in KGs. First, to optimize the learning order, we introduce a hierarchical strategy, ranking new triples for layer-by-layer learning. By employing the inter- and intra-hierarchical orders together, new triples are grouped into layers based on the graph structure features. Secondly, to preserve the old knowledge effectively, we devise a novel incremental distillation mechanism, which facilitates the seamless transfer of entity representations from the previous layer to the next one, promoting old knowledge preservation. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm to avoid the over-corruption of old knowledge influenced by under-trained new knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IncDE over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the incremental distillation mechanism contributes to improvements of 0.2%-6.5% in the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score. More exploratory experiments validate the effectiveness of IncDE in proficiently learning new knowledge while preserving old knowledge across all time steps.

However, existing MKGC approaches largely ignore that visual information may introduce noise and lead to uncertainty when adding them to the traditional KG embeddings due to the contribution of each associated image to entity is different in diverse link scenarios. Moreover, treating each triple independently when learning entity embeddings leads to local structural and the whole graph information missing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel link aware fusion and aggregation based multimodal knowledge graph completion model named LAFA, which is composed of link aware fusion module and link aware aggregation module. The link aware fusion module alleviates noise of irrelevant visual information by calculating the importance between an entity and its associated images in different link scenarios, and fuses the visual and structural embeddings according to the importance through our proposed modality embedding fusion mechanism. The link aware aggregation module assigns neighbor structural information to a given central entity by calculating the importance between the entity and its neighbors, and aggregating the fused embeddings through linear combination according to the importance. Extensive experiments on standard datasets validate that LAFA can obtain state-of-the-art performance. Copyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) events is essential for avoiding this issue. Recently, various artificial intelligence-based approaches have been proposed for predicting DDI events. However, DDI events are associated with complex relationships and mechanisms among drugs, targets, enzymes, transporters, molecular structures, etc. Existing approaches either partially or loosely consider these relationships and mechanisms by a non-end-to-end learning framework, resulting in sub-optimal feature extractions and fusions for prediction. Different from them, this paper proposes a Multimodal Knowledge Graph Fused End-to-end Neural Network (MKG-FENN) that consists of two main parts: multimodal knowledge graph (MKG) and fused end-to-end neural network (FENN). First, MKG is constructed by comprehensively exploiting DDI events-associated relationships and mechanisms from four knowledge graphs of drugs-chemical entities, drug-substructures, drugs-drugs, and molecular structures. Correspondingly, a four channels graph neural network is designed to extract high-order and semantic features from MKG. Second, FENN designs a multi-layer perceptron to fuse the extracted features by end-to-end learning. With such designs, the feature extractions and fusions of DDI events are guaranteed to be comprehensive and optimal for prediction. Through extensive experiments on real drug datasets, we demonstrate that MKG-FENN exhibits high accuracy and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting DDI events.

Consequently, the expressive ability of these models is limited. To address the problems, we propose a novel GraIL-based framework, termed MINES, by introducing a Message Intercommunication mechanism on the Neighbor-Enhanced Subgraph. Concretely, the message intercommunication mechanism is designed to capture the omitted hidden mutual information. It introduces bi-directed information interactions between connected entities by inserting an undirected/bi-directed GCN layer between uni-directed RGCN layers. Moreover, inspired by the success of involving more neighbors in other graph-based tasks, we extend the neighborhood area beyond the enclosing subgraph to enhance the information collection for inductive relation reasoning. Extensive experiments prove the promising capacity of the proposed MINES from various aspects, especially for the superiority, effectiveness, and transfer ability.

Classic code search approaches, using information retrieval technologies, fail to utilize code semantics and bring noisy and irrelevant. During the last recent years, there has been an ample increase in the number of deep learning-based approaches, which embeds lexical semantics into unified vectors to achieve higher-level mapping between natural language queries and source code. However, these approaches are struggling with how to mine and utilize deep code semantics. In this work, we study how to leverage deeper source code semantics in graph-based source code search, given graph-based representation is a promising way of capturing program and has rich explainability. We propose a novel code search approach called EAGCS (Edge Attention-based Graph Code Search), which is composed of a novel code graph representation method called APDG (Advanced Program Dependence Graph) and a graph neural network called EAGGNN (Edge Attention-based GGNN) which can learn the latent code semantics of APDG. Experiment results demonstrate that our model outperforms the GGNN-based search model and DeepCS. Moreover, our comparison study shows that different edge enhancement strategies have different contributions to learning the code semantics. © 2022 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

Group intention mining through automatic technologies for managing social crises has gained extensive attention. This paper presents an overview of research on group intention mining in social crisis events, covering three areas: knowledge graph inference, intention attribution, and risk management. Knowledge graph inference facilitates the detection of group intention in crisis events. It is supported by the construction of crisis knowledge graphs, which organize crisis elements and inter-element relations into structured semantic knowledge. The interpretable semantics in the crisis knowledge graphs enables attribution of intention. Group intention mining consists of intention detection and intention attribution, serving the risk management of social crisis events. To gain insights into the process of group intention mining in social crises, the Covid-19 event is selected as a case study.

In this paper, we find that a simple attention-based method can outperform a general GNN-based approach for KGC.

In particular, it is important to verify whether such metrics used for evaluating AQG systems focus on answerability of the generated question by preferring questions which contain all relevant information such as question type (Wh-types), entities, relations, etc. In this work, we show that current automatic evaluation metrics based on n-gram similarity do not always correlate well with human judgments about answerability of a question.

Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a data fusion method suitable for medical data using data of pituitary adenomas integrated from different sources. The overall goal was to construct a knowledge graph for pituitary adenoma (KGPA) to be used for knowledge discovery. Methods: A complete framework suitable for the construction of a medical knowledge graph was developed, which was used to build the KGPA. The schema of the KGPA was manually constructed. Information of pituitary adenoma was automatically extracted from Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs) and medical websites through a conditional random field model and newly designed web wrappers. An entity fusion method is proposed based on the head-and-tail entity fusion model to fuse the data from heterogeneous sources. Results: Data were extracted from 300 CEMRs of pituitary adenoma and 4 health portals. Entity fusion was carried out using the proposed data fusion model. The F1 scores of the head and tail entity fusions were 97.32% and 98.57%, respectively. Triples from the constructed KGPA were selected for evaluation, demonstrating 95.4% accuracy.

This obviates the need for cumbersome, time- and resource-intensive manual feature engineering, especially from unstructured data such as text, images, or graphs. Most previous techniques have used neural network-based autoencoders to learn patient representations, primarily from clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs). Knowledge graphs (KGs), with clinical entities as nodes and their relations as edges, can be extracted automatically from biomedical literature and provide complementary information to EMR data that have been found to provide valuable predictive signals. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of collective matrix factorization (CMF), both the classical variant and a recent neural architecture called deep CMF (DCMF), in integrating heterogeneous data sources from EMR and KG to obtain patient representations for clinical decision support tasks. Methods: Using a recent formulation for obtaining graph representations through matrix factorization within the context of CMF, we infused auxiliary information during patient representation learning. We also extended the DCMF architecture to create a task-specific end-to-end model that learns to simultaneously find effective patient representations and predictions. We compared the efficacy of such a model to that of first learning unsupervised representations and then independently learning a predictive model. We evaluated patient representation learning using CMF-based methods and autoencoders for 2 clinical decision support tasks on a large EMR data set. Results: Our experiments show that DCMF provides a seamless way for integrating multiple sources of data to obtain patient representations, both in unsupervised and supervised settings. Its performance in single-source settings is comparable with that of previous autoencoder-based representation learning methods. When DCMF is used to obtain representations from a combination of EMR and KG, where most previous autoencoder-based methods cannot be used directly, its performance is superior to that of previous nonneural methods for CMF. Infusing information from KGs into patient representations using DCMF was found to improve downstream predictive performance. Conclusions: Our experiments indicate that DCMF is a versatile model that can be used to obtain representations from single and multiple data sources and combine information from EMR data and KGs. Furthermore, DCMF can be used to learn representations in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Thus, DCMF offers an effective way of integrating heterogeneous data sources and infusing auxiliary knowledge into patient representations. © Sajit Kumar, Alicia Nanelia, Ragunathan Mariappan, Adithya Rajagopal, Vaibhav Rajan.

Objective: This paper aims to construct a TCM knowledge graph (KG) from Chinese physicians and apply it to the decision-making related to diagnosis and treatment in TCM. Methods: A new framework leveraging a representation learning method for TCM KG construction and application was designed. A transformer-based Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE) model was applied to KG representation learning and knowledge distillation. Automatic identification and expansion of multihop relations were integrated with the CoKE model as a pipeline. Based on the framework, a TCM KG containing 59,882 entities (eg, diseases, symptoms, examinations, drugs), 17 relations, and 604,700 triples was constructed. The framework was validated through a link predication task. Results: Experiments showed that the framework outperforms a set of baseline models in the link prediction task using the standard metrics mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@N. The knowledge graph embedding (KGE) multitagged TCM discriminative diagnosis metrics also indicated the improvement of our framework compared with the baseline models. Conclusions: Experiments showed that the clinical KG representation learning and application framework is effective for knowledge discovery and decision-making assistance in diagnosis and treatment. Our framework shows superiority of application prospects in tasks such as KG-fused multimodal information diagnosis, KGE-based text classification, and knowledge inference–based medical question answering. ©Heng Weng, Jielong Chen, Aihua Ou, Yingrong Lao.",clinical; framework; knowledge discovery; knowledge embedding; knowledge graph; medicine; traditional Chinese medicine,,FALSE

However, providing personalized reminiscence therapy can be challenging for caregivers and family members. Objective: This study aimed to achieve three objectives: (1) design and develop the GoodTimes app, an interactive multimodal photo album that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to engage users in personalized conversations and storytelling about their pictures, encompassing family, friends, and special moments; (2) examine the app's functionalities in various scenarios using use-case studies and assess the app's usability and user experience through the user study; and (3) investigate the app's potential as a supplementary tool for reminiscence therapy among cognitively intact older adults, aiming to enhance their psychological well-being by facilitating the recollection of past experiences. Methods: We used state-of-the-art AI technologies, including image recognition, natural language processing, knowledge graph, logic, and machine learning, to develop GoodTimes. First, we constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph that models the information required for effective communication, including photos, people, locations, time, and stories related to the photos. Next, we developed a voice assistant that interacts with users by leveraging the knowledge graph and machine learning techniques. Then, we created various use cases to examine the functions of the system in different scenarios. Finally, to evaluate GoodTimes' usability, we conducted a study with older adults (N=13; age range 58-84, mean 65.8 years). The study period started from January to March 2023. Results: The use-case tests demonstrated the performance of GoodTimes in handling a variety of scenarios, highlighting its versatility and adaptability. For the user study, the feedback from our participants was highly positive, with 92% (12/13) reporting a positive experience conversing with GoodTimes. All participants mentioned that the app invoked pleasant memories and aided in recollecting loved ones, resulting in a sense of happiness for the majority (11/13, 85%). Additionally, a significant majority found GoodTimes to be helpful (11/13, 85%) and user-friendly (12/13, 92%). Most participants (9/13, 69%) expressed a desire to use the app frequently, although some (4/13, 31%) indicated a need for technical support to navigate the system effectively. Conclusions: Our AI-based interactive photo album, GoodTimes, was able to engage users in browsing their photos and conversing about them. Preliminary evidence supports GoodTimes' usability and benefits cognitively intact older adults. Future work is needed to explore its potential positive effects among older adults with cognitive impairment. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Most previous text-video retrieval works utilize implicit knowledge of pre-trained models such as contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to boost retrieval performance.

This task has been extensively studied for traditional graph representations, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), using techniques like inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing ILP methods assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other applications such as procedural instructions, scene graphs, and program executions. While ILP is beneficial for these applications, applying it to those graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a type of hypergraph with temporal events. In this work, we propose temporal inductive logic reasoning (TILR), an ILP method that reasons on temporal hypergraphs. To enable hypergraph reasoning, we introduce the multi-start random B-walk, a novel graph traversal method for hypergraphs. By combining it with a path-consistency algorithm, TILR learns logic rules by generalizing from both temporal and relational data. To address the lack of hypergraph benchmarks, we create and release two temporal hypergraph datasets: YouCook2-HG and nuScenes-HG.

The prevailing method for this problem is query embedding, which embeds KG units (i.e., entities and relations) and complex queries into low-dimensional space. Recent developments in the field show that embedding queries as geometric shapes is a viable means for modeling entity set and logical relationships between them. Despite being promising, current geometric-based methods face challenges in capturing hierarchical structures of complex queries, which leaves considerable room for improvement. This paper presents POINE2, a geometric-based query embedding framework based on hyperbolic geometry to handle complex queries on knowledge graphs. POINE2 maps entities and queries as geometric shapes on a Cartesian product space of Poincaré ball spaces. To capture the hierarchical structures of complex queries, we use the Poincaré radius to represent the different levels of the hierarchy, and we use the aperture of the shape to indicate semantic differences at the same level of the hierarchy. Additionally, POINE2 offers a flexible and expressive definition of logical operations. Experimental results show that POINE2 outperforms existing salient geometric-based embedding methods and significantly improves these methods on evaluation datasets. © 2023 The Authors.",,Geometry; Graph embeddings; Semantics; 'current; Complex queries; Embeddings; Geometric shape; Hierarchical structures; Knowledge graphs; Logical relationships; Low-dimensional spaces; Model entities; Poincare; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Most previous studies treat the graph structure as a special modality, and fuse different modality information with separate uni-modal encoders, neglecting valuable relational associations in modalities. Other studies refine each uni-modal information with graph structures, but may introduce unnecessary relations in specific modalities. To this end, we propose a novel local-to-global interaction network for MMEA, termed as LoginMEA. Particularly, we first fuse local multi-modal interactions to generate holistic entity semantics and then refine them with global relational interactions of entity neighbors. In this design, the uni-modal information is fused adaptively, and can be refined with relations accordingly. To enrich local interactions of multi-modal entity information, we devise modality weights and low-rank interactive fusion, allowing diverse impacts and element-level feature interactions among modalities. To capture global interactions of graph structures, we adopt relation reflection graph attention networks, which fully capture relational associations between entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior results of our method over 5 cross-KG or bilingual benchmark datasets, indicating the effectiveness of capturing local and global interactions. © 2024 The Authors.",,Benchmarking; Knowledge graph; Modal analysis; Network theory (graphs); Bilinguals; Element level; Feature interactions; Global interaction; Graph structures; Interaction networks; Knowledge graphs; Local interactions; Multi-modal; Multimodal Interaction; Semantics,FALSE

These mechanisms are often mediated by genes and genetic variations and are often studied through the lens of genome-wide association studies. Linking these two disparate layers (i.e., imaging and genetic variation) through causal relationships between biological entities involved in the disease's etiology would pave the way to large-scale mechanistic reasoning and interpretation. Objective: We explore how genetic variants may lead to functional alterations of intermediate molecular traits, which can further impact neuroimaging hallmarks over a series of biological processes across multiple scales. Methods: We present an approach in which knowledge pertaining to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and imaging readouts is extracted from the literature, encoded in Biological Expression Language, and used in a novel workflow to assist in the functional interpretation of SNPs in a clinical context. Results: We demonstrate our approach in a case scenario which proposes KANSL1 as a candidate gene that accounts for the clinically reported correlation between the incidence of the genetic variants and hippocampal atrophy. We find that the workflow prioritizes multiple mechanisms reported in the literature through which KANSL1 may have an impact on hippocampal atrophy such as through the dysregulation of cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity, and metabolic processes. Conclusion: We have presented an approach that enables pinpointing relevant genetic variants as well as investigating their functional role in biological processes spanning across several, diverse biological scales. © 2021-The authors.

This work distills a generic architecture of a neural EL system and discusses its components, such as candidate generation, mention-context encoding, and entity ranking, summarizing prominent methods for each of them. The vast variety of modifications of this general architecture are grouped by several common themes: joint entity mention detection and disambiguation, models for global linking, domain-independent techniques including zero-shot and distant supervision methods, and cross-lingual approaches. Since many neural models take advantage of entity and mention/context embeddings to represent their meaning, this work also overviews prominent entity embedding techniques.

In comparison to domains such as movies or e-commerce, where recommender systems have proved highly successful, the characteristics of the news domain (e.g., high frequency of articles appearing and becoming outdated, greater dynamics of user interest, less explicit relations between articles, and lack of explicit user feedback) pose additional challenges for the recommendation models. While some of these can be overcome by conventional recommendation techniques, injecting external knowledge into news recommender systems has been proposed in order to enhance recommendations by capturing information and patterns not contained in the text and metadata of articles, and hence, tackle shortcomings of traditional models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of knowledge-aware news recommender systems. We propose a taxonomy that divides the models into three categories: neural methods, non-neural entity-centric methods, and non-neural path-based methods. Moreover, the underlying recommendation algorithms, as well as their evaluations are analyzed.

In addition to planned schedules, access to live schedule updates (e.g. delays or cancellations) and historical data is fundamental to enable reliable applications and to support machine learning use cases. However publishing such dynamic data further increases the computational burden for data publishers, resulting in often unavailable historical data and live schedule updates for most public transport networks. In this paper we apply and extend the current Linked Connections approach for static data to also support cost-efficient live and historical public transport data publishing on the Web. Our contributions include (i) a reference specification and system architecture to support cost-efficient publishing of dynamic public transport schedules and historical data; (ii) empirical evaluations on route planning query performance based on data fragmentation size, publishing costs and a comparison with a traditional route planning engine such as OpenTripPlanner; (iii) an analysis of potential correlations of query performance with particular public transport network characteristics such as size, average degree, density, clustering coefficient and average connection duration. Results confirm that fragmentation size influences route planning query performance and converges on an optimal fragment size per network. Size (stops), density and connection duration also show correlation with route planning query performance. Our approach proves to be more cost-efficient and in some cases outperforms OpenTripPlanner when supporting the earliest arrival time route planning use case. Moreover, the cost of publishing live and historical schedules remains in the same order of magnitude for server-side resources compared to publishing planned schedules only. Yet, further optimizations are needed for larger networks (>1000 stops) to be useful in practice. Additional dataset fragmentation strategies (e.g. geospatial) may be studied for designing more scalable and performant Web apis that adapt to particular use cases, not only limited to the public transport domain.  © 2023-The authors.

When these data sources are large, the materialization of the entire knowledge graph may be computationally expensive and not suitable for those cases where a rapid materialization is required. In this work, we propose an approach to overcome this limitation, based on the novel concept of mapping partitions. Mapping partitions are defined as groups of mapping rules that generate disjoint subsets of the knowledge graph. Each of these groups can be processed separately, reducing the total amount of memory and execution time required by the materialization process. We have included this optimization in our materialization engine Morph-KGC, and we have evaluated it over three different benchmarks. Our experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art techniques, the use of mapping partitions in Morph-KGC presents the following advantages: (i) it decreases significantly the time required for materialization, (ii) it reduces the maximum peak of memory used, and (iii) it scales to data sizes that other engines are not capable of processing currently.  © 2024 - The authors.

However, the ability to process information in multi-modal environments remains limited. Inspired by the research and applications of natural language processing across different modalities, our goal is to accurately extract frame-level semantic information from videos and ultimately transmit high-quality videos. Specifically, we propose a deep learning-based Multi-Modal Mutual Enhancement Video Semantic Communication system, called M3E-VSC. Built upon a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN), our system aims to leverage mutual enhancement among different modalities by using text as the main carrier of transmission. With it, the semantic information can be extracted from key-frame images and audio of the video and perform differential value to ensure that the extracted text conveys accurate semantic information with fewer bits, thus improving the capacity of the system. Furthermore, a multi-frame semantic detection module is designed to facilitate semantic transitions during video generation. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model maintains high robustness in complex noise environments, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, significantly improving the accuracy and speed of semantic transmission in video communication by approximately 50 percent. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

Besides the status of the power grid itself, environmental information is also necessary for equipment defect detection. At the same time, different types of intelligent sensors can monitor environmental information, such as temperature, humidity, dust, etc. Therefore, we apply the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the related environment and pervasive interconnections to diverse physical objects. However, the data related to device defects in the existing Internet of Things are complex and lack uniform association hence building a knowledge graph is proposed to solve the problems. Intelligent equipment defect domain ontology is the semantic basis for constructing a defect knowledge graph, which can be used to organize, share, and analyze equipment defect-related knowledge. At present, there are a lot of relevant data in the field of intelligent equipment defects. These equipment defect data often focus on a single aspect of the defect field. It is difficult to integrate the database with various types of equipment defect information. This paper combines the characteristics of existing data sources to build a general intelligent equipment defect domain ontology. Based on ontology, this paper proposed the BERT-BiLSTM-Att-CRF model to recognize the entities. This method solves the problem of diverse entity names and insufficient feature information extraction in the field of equipment defect field. The final experiment proves that this model is superior to other models in precision, recall, and F1 value.

However, the content of online self-management programs varies widely, making them difficult to compare. Aim: This study aims to employ generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based knowledge graphs and network analysis to categorize and structure mHealth content at the example of a fibromyalgia self-management program. Methods: A multimodal mHealth online self-management program targeting fibromyalgia and post-viral fibromyalgia-like syndromes was developed. In addition to general content, the program was customized to address specific features and digital personas identified through hierarchical agglomerative clustering applied to a cohort of 202 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes undergoing multimodal assessment. Text files consisting of 22,150 words divided into 24 modules were used as the input data. Two generative AI web applications, ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and Infranodus (Nodus Labs), were used to create knowledge graphs and perform text network analysis, including 3D visualization. A sentiment analysis of 129 patient feedback entries was performed. Results: The ChatGPT-generated knowledge graph model provided a simple visual overview with five primary edges: “Mental health challenges”, “Stress and its impact”, “Immune system function”, “Long COVID and fibromyalgia” and “Pain management and therapeutic approaches”. The 3D visualization provided a more complex knowledge graph, with the term “pain” appearing as the central edge, closely connecting with “sleep”, “body”, and “stress”. Topical cluster analysis identified categories such as “chronic pain management”, “sleep hygiene”, “immune system function”, “cognitive therapy”, “healthy eating”, “emotional development”, “fibromyalgia causes”, and “deep relaxation”. Gap analysis highlighted missing links, such as between “negative behavior” and “systemic inflammation”. Retro-engineering of the self-management program showed significant conceptual similarities between the knowledge graph and the original text analysis. Sentiment analysis of free text patient comments revealed that most relevant topics were addressed by the online program, with the exception of social contacts. Conclusion: Generative AI tools for text network analysis can effectively structure and illustrate DTx content. Knowledge graphs are valuable for increasing the transparency of self-management programs, developing new conceptual frameworks, and incorporating feedback loops. 2024 Blanchard, Venerito, Ming Azevedo and Hügle.",artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes; fibromyalgia; knowledge graph; large language model; mHealth (mobile health),Article; artificial intelligence; Brief Pain Inventory; ChatGPT; chronic pain; cognitive behavioral therapy; cohort analysis; depression; emotional development; endometriosis; Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire; fibromyalgia; generative artificial intelligence-based knowledge graph; genetic predisposition; health care delivery; hierarchical clustering; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; large language model; loneliness; long COVID; machine learning; mental health; mobile health; musculoskeletal pain; network analysis; obesity; Oswestry Disability Index; Pain Catastrophizing scale; posttraumatic stress disorder; proof of concept; self care; sentiment analysis; storytelling; stress management; Tampa scale for kinesiophobia; Toronto Alexithymia scale,FALSE

The effective linkage of these characteristics with maritime infrastructure, such as berths, is critical for the enhancement of ship navigation systems. This endeavor is paramount not only as a research focus within maritime information science but also for the progression of intelligent maritime systems. Traditional methodologies have primarily emphasized the analysis of navigational paths of vessels without an extensive consideration of the geographical dynamics between ships and port infrastructure. However, the introduction of knowledge graphs has enabled the integration of disparate data sources, facilitating new insights that propel the development of intelligent maritime systems. This manuscript presents a novel framework using knowledge graph technology for profound analysis of maritime data. Utilizing automatic identification system (AIS) data alongside spatial information from port facilities, the framework forms semantic triplet connections among ships, anchorages, berths, and waterways. This enables the semantic modeling of maritime behaviors, offering precise identification of ships through their diverse semantic information. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic relations between ships and berths, a reverse semantic knowledge graph for berths is constructed, which is specifically tailored to ship type, size, and category. The manuscript critically evaluates a range of graph embedding techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and classification strategies through experimental frameworks to determine the most efficacious methodologies. The findings reveal that the maritime knowledge graph significantly enhances the semantic understanding of unmanned maritime equipment, thereby improving decision-making capabilities. Additionally, it establishes a semantic foundation for the development of expansive maritime models, illustrating the potential of knowledge graph technology in advancing intelligent maritime systems.

For knowledge graph construction tasks (such as named entity recognition, relation extraction), classical BERT-based methods require a large amount of training data to ensure model performance. However, real-world medical annotation data, especially disease-specific annotation samples, are very limited. In addition, existing models do not perform well in recognizing out-of-distribution entities and relations that are not seen in the training phase. Method: In this study, we present a novel and practical pipeline for constructing a heart failure knowledge graph using large language models and medical expert refinement. We apply prompt engineering to the three phases of schema design: schema design, information extraction, and knowledge completion. The best performance is achieved by designing task-specific prompt templates combined with the TwoStepChat approach. Results: Experiments on two datasets show that the TwoStepChat method outperforms the Vanillia prompt and outperforms the fine-tuned BERT-based baselines. Moreover, our method saves 65% of the time compared to manual annotation and is better suited to extract the out-of-distribution information in the real world.

By introducing a neural architecture search (NAS) and knowledge graphs, an attempt is made to bridge this gap, targeting enhanced detection accuracy and robustness. A disease detection model based on the Transformer and knowledge graphs is proposed. Upon evaluating various object detection models on edge computing platforms, it was observed that the dynamic head module surpassed the performance of the multi-head attention mechanism during data processing. The experimental results further indicated that when integrating all the data augmentation methods, the model achieved an optimal mean average precision (mAP) of 0.94.

To better understand emotions, we integrated interdisciplinary knowledge about emotions from various domains such as neurosciences (e.g., neurobiology), physiology, and psychology (affective sciences, positive psychology, cognitive psychology, psychophysiology, neuropsychology, etc.). To organize the knowledge, we employ technologies such as Artificial Intelligence with Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Reasoning. Furthermore, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can help to acquire physiological data knowledge. The goal of this paper is to aggregate the interdisciplinary knowledge and implement it within the Emotional Knowledge Graph (EmoKG). The Emotional Knowledge Graph is used within our naturopathy recommender system that suggests food to boost emotion (e.g., chocolate contains magnesium that is recommended when we feel depressed). The recommender system also answers a set of competency questions to easily retrieve emotional related-knowledge from EmoKG, such as what are the basic emotions and the more sophisticated ones, what are the neurotransmitters and hormones related to emotions, etc. To follow FAIR principles, EmoKG is mapped to existing knowledge bases found on the BioPortal biomedical ontology catalog such as SNOMEDCT, FMA, RXNORM, MedDRA, and also from emotion ontologies (when available online). We design the LOV4IoT-Emotion ontology catalog that encourages researchers from heterogeneous communities to apply FAIR principles by releasing online their (emotion) ontologies, datasets, rules, etc. The set of ontology codes shared online can be semi-automatically processed; if not available, the scientific publications describing the emotion ontologies are semi-automatically processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies.

In this paper, in order to address the insufficient representation of user and item embeddings in existing knowledge graph-based recommendation methods, a knowledge-aware enhanced network, combining neighborhood information recommendation (KCNR), is proposed. Specifically, KCNR first encodes prior information about the user–item interaction, and obtains the user’s different knowledge neighbors by propagating them in the knowledge graph, and uses a knowledge-aware attention network to distinguish and aggregate the contributions of the different neighbors in the knowledge graph, as a way to enrich the user’s description. Similarly, KCNR samples multiple-hop neighbors of item entities in the knowledge graph, and has a bias to aggregate the neighborhood information, to enhance the item embedding representation. With the above processing, KCNR can automatically discover structural and associative semantic information in the knowledge graph, and capture users’ latent distant personalized preferences, by propagating them across the knowledge graph. In addition, considering the relevance of items to entities in the knowledge graph, KCNR has designed an information complementarity module, which automatically shares potential interaction characteristics of items and entities, and enables items and entities to complement the available information.

Outcomes are of the utmost importance for artificial intelligence–empowered teaching and learning. Unsupervised educational concept extraction methods based on pre-trained models continue to proliferate due to ongoing advances in semantic representation. However, it remains challenging to directly apply pre-trained large language models to extract educational concepts; pre-trained models are built on extensive corpora and do not necessarily cover all subject-specific concepts. To address this gap, we propose a novel unsupervised method for educational concept extraction based on word embedding refinement (i.e., word embedding refinement–based educational concept extraction (WERECE)). It integrates a manifold learning algorithm to adapt a pre-trained model for extracting educational concepts while accounting for the geometric information in semantic computation. We further devise a discriminant function based on semantic clustering and Box–Cox transformation to enhance WERECE’s accuracy and reliability. We evaluate its performance on two newly constructed datasets, EDU-DT and EDUTECH-DT. Experimental results show that WERECE achieves an average precision up to 85.9%, recall up to 87.0%, and F1 scores up to 86.4%, which significantly outperforms baselines (TextRank, term frequency–inverse document frequency, isolation forest, K-means, and one-class support vector machine) on educational concept extraction. Notably, when WERECE is implemented with different parameter settings, its precision and recall sensitivity remain robust.

However, we found that the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models do not handle the link between relations and entities well. For this reason, this paper proposes a link prediction model (LPM) based on feature mapping and bi-directional convolution. For the modeling of the task, an encoding layer–mapping layer–decoding layer structure is used. Among these layers, the encoding layer adopts a graph attention network to encode multi-hop triad information and obtains richer encoding of entities and relationships. The mapping layer can realize the mapping transformation between entities and relations and project the entity encoding in the space of relation encoding to capture the subtle connection between entities and relations. The decoding layer adopts bidirectional convolution to merge and decode the triples in a sequential inverse order, which makes the decoding layer model more advantageous in prediction. In addition, the decoding layer also adopts the r-drop training method to effectively reduce the distribution error generated by training between models and enhance the robustness of the model.

Integrating these data into knowledge graphs can help models to better understand and utilize these rich sources of information. The basic idea of the existing methods for entity alignment in knowledge graphs is to extract different data features, such as structure, text, attributes, images, etc., and then fuse these different modal features. The entity similarity in different knowledge graphs is calculated based on the fused features. However, the structures, attribute information, image information, text descriptions, etc., of different knowledge graphs often have significant differences. Directly integrating different modal information can easily introduce noise, thus affecting the effectiveness of the entity alignment. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a knowledge graph entity alignment method based on multimodal data supervision. First, Transformer is used to obtain encoded representations of knowledge graph entities. Then, a multimodal supervised method is used for learning the entity representations in the knowledge graph so that the vector representations of the entities contain rich multimodal semantic information, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned entity representations. Finally, the information from different modalities is mapped to a shared low-dimensional subspace, making similar entities closer in the subspace, thus optimizing the entity alignment effect.

To address the problem where users, relying solely on their own knowledge, struggle to diagnose faults in consumer electronics promptly and accurately, we propose a multimodal knowledge graph-based text generation method. Our method begins by using deep learning models like the Residual Network (ResNet) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract features from user-provided fault information, which can include images, text, audio, and even olfactory data. These multimodal features are then combined to form a comprehensive representation. The fused features are fed into a graph convolutional network (GCN) for fault inference, identifying potential fault nodes in the electronics. These fault nodes are subsequently fed into a pre-constructed knowledge graph to determine the final diagnosis. Finally, this information is processed through the Bias-term Fine-tuning (BitFit) enhanced Chinese Pre-trained Transformer (CPT) model, which generates the final fault diagnosis text for the user.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge-guided heterogeneous graph convolutional network for aspect-based sentiment analysis (KHGCN). Specifically, we consider merging subword vectors utilizing a dynamic weight mechanism in the BERT embedding layer. Additionally, heterogeneous graphs are constructed to fuse different feature associations between words, and graph convolutional networks are utilized to identify context-specific syntactic features.

Beyond that, existing studies predominantly focus on analyzing a single DDIs, failing to explore multiple similar DDIs simultaneously, thus limiting the discovery of common mechanisms underlying DDIs. To address these limitations, this research proposes a method based on M-Transformer and knowledge graph for predicting DDIs, comprising a dual-pathway approach and neural network. In the first pathway, we leverage the interpretability of the transformer to capture the intricate relationships between drug features using the multi-head attention mechanism, identifying and discarding redundant information to obtain a more refined and information-dense drug representation. However, due to the potential difficulty for a single transformer model to understand features from multiple semantic spaces, we adopted M-Transformer to understand the structural and pharmacological information of the drug as well as the connections between them. In the second pathway, we constructed a drug–drug interaction knowledge graph (DDIKG) using drug representation vectors obtained from M-Transformer as nodes and DDI types as edges. Subsequently, drug edges with similar interactions were aggregated using a graph neural network (GNN).

Existing approaches tend to focus on coarse-grained alignment at the global level and do not take into account the disease characteristics of radiology images at fine-grained semantics, which results in the generated reports potentially omitting key disease diagnostic descriptions. In this work, we propose a new approach, disease-knowledge-enhanced fine-grained image–text alignment for automatic radiology report generation (DKA-RG). The method combines global and disease-level alignment, thus facilitating the extraction of fine-grained disease features by the model. Our approach also introduces a knowledge graph to inject medical domain expertise into the model. Our proposed DKA-RG consists of two training steps: the image–report alignment stage and the image-to-report generation stage. In the alignment stage, we use global contrastive learning to align images and texts from a high level and also augment disease contrastive learning with medical knowledge to enhance the disease detection capability. In the report generation stage, the report text generated from the images is more accurate in describing the disease information thanks to sufficient alignment. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two widely used datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our DKA-RG on the task of radiology report generation.

Several rare disruptive gene variants have been associated with ALS and are responsible for about 15% of all cases. Although our knowledge of the genetic landscape of this disease is improving, it remains limited. Machine learning models trained on the available protein–protein interaction and phenotype-genotype association data can use our current knowledge of the disease genetics for the prediction of novel candidate genes. Here, we describe a knowledge-based machine learning method for this purpose. We trained our model on protein–protein interaction data from IntAct, gene function annotation from Gene Ontology, and known disease-gene associations from DisGeNet. Using several sets of known ALS genes from public databases and a manual review as input, we generated a list of new candidate genes for each input set. We investigated the relevance of the predicted genes in ALS by using the available summary statistics from the largest ALS genome-wide association study and by performing functional and phenotype enrichment analysis. The predicted sets were enriched for genes associated with other neurodegenerative diseases known to overlap with ALS genetically and phenotypically, as well as for biological processes associated with the disease. Moreover, using ALS genes from ClinVar and our manual review as input, the predicted sets were enriched for ALS-associated genes (ClinVar p = 0.038 and manual review p = 0.060) when used for gene prioritisation in a genome-wide association study. © 2020 by the authors.

However, EHRs are often fragmented, unstructured, and difficult to analyze due to the heterogeneity of the data sources and the sheer volume of information. Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing and representing complex relationships within large datasets. In this study, we explore the use of knowledge graphs to capture and represent complex relationships within EHRs. Specifically, we address the following research question: Can a knowledge graph created using the MIMIC III dataset and GraphDB effectively capture semantic relationships within EHRs and enable more efficient and accurate data analysis? We map the MIMIC III dataset to an ontology using text refinement and Protege; then, we create a knowledge graph using GraphDB and use SPARQL queries to retrieve and analyze information from the graph. Our results demonstrate that knowledge graphs can effectively capture semantic relationships within EHRs, enabling more efficient and accurate data analysis. We provide examples of how our implementation can be used to analyze patient outcomes and identify potential risk factors. Our results demonstrate that knowledge graphs are an effective tool for capturing semantic relationships within EHRs, enabling a more efficient and accurate data analysis. Our implementation provides valuable insights into patient outcomes and potential risk factors, contributing to the growing body of literature on the use of knowledge graphs in healthcare. In particular, our study highlights the potential of knowledge graphs to support decision-making and improve patient outcomes by enabling a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of EHR data. Overall, our research contributes to a better understanding of the value of knowledge graphs in healthcare and lays the foundation for further research in this area. © 2023 by the authors.",data analysis; electronic health records; GraphDB; knowledge graphs; MIMIC III; ontology; semantic relationships,,FALSE

It is challenging to construct the digital twin scenarios efficiently for mountain highways. To solve this problem, this article proposes a knowledge-guided fusion expression method for digital twin scenes of mountain highways. First, we explore the expression features and interrelationships of mountain highway scenes to establish the knowledge graph of mountain highway scenes. Second, by utilizing scene knowledge to construct spatial semantic constraint rules, we achieve efficient fusion modeling of basic geographic scenes and dynamic and static ancillary facilities, thereby reducing the complexity of scene modeling. Finally, a multi-level visualisation publishing scheme is established to improve the efficiency of scene visualisation. On this basis, a prototype system is developed, and case experimental analysis is conducted to validate the research. The results of the experiment indicate that the suggested method can accomplish the fusion modelling of mountain highway scenes through knowledge guidance and semantic constraints. Moreover, the construction time for the model fusion is less than 5.7 ms; meanwhile, the dynamic drawing efficiency of the scene is maintained above 60 FPS. Thus, the construction of twinned scenes can be achieved quickly and efficiently, the effect of replicating reality with virtuality is accomplished, and the informatisation management capacity of mountain highways is enhanced. © 2023 by the authors.",digital twin scene; fusion expression; knowledge graph; mountain highway; spatial semantic constraint,,FALSE

The core concern with the co-administration of drugs is that it may produce adverse drug—drug interaction (DDI), which can cause unexpected bodily injury. Therefore, it is essential to identify potential DDI. Most existing methods in silico only judge whether two drugs interact, ignoring the importance of interaction events to study the mechanism implied in combination drugs. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework named MSEDDI that comprehensively considers multi-scale embedding representations of the drug for predicting drug—drug interaction events. In MSEDDI, we design three-channel networks to process biomedical network-based knowledge graph embedding, SMILES sequence-based notation embedding, and molecular graph-based chemical structure embedding, respectively. Finally, we fuse three heterogeneous features from channel outputs through a self-attention mechanism and feed them to the linear layer predictor. In the experimental section, we evaluate the performance of all methods on two different prediction tasks on two datasets. The results show that MSEDDI outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.

Knowledge graphs, an effective technology for knowledge representation and management, have been successfully utilized to manage massive educational resources. However, the existing research on constructing educational knowledge graphs ignores multiple modalities and their relationships, such as teacher speeches and their relationship with knowledge. To tackle this problem, we propose an automatic approach to construct multi-modal educational knowledge graphs that integrate speech as a modal resource to facilitate the reuse of educational resources. Specifically, we first propose a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model based on education lexicon, called EduBERT, which can adaptively capture effective information in the education field. We also add a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) to effectively identify educational entities. Then, the locational information of the entity is incorporated into BERT to extract the educational relationship. In addition, to cover the shortage of traditional text-based knowledge graphs, we focus on collecting teacher speech to construct a multi-modal knowledge graph. We propose a speech-fusion method that links these data into the graph as a class of entities. The numeric results show that our proposed approach can manage and present various modes of educational resources and that it can provide better education services. © 2022 by the authors.

In this work, drones are equipped with sensors (radar, lidar, camera, etc.), capable of detecting obstacles, accidents, and the like. Due to their small size and capability to move places, drones can be used collect perception data and transmit them to the vehicle using a secure method, such as an RF, VLC, or hybrid communication protocol. These data obtained from different sources are then combined and processed using a knowledge base and some set of logical rules. The knowledge base is represented by ontology; it contains various logical rules related to the weather, the appropriateness of sensors with respect to the weather, and the activation mechanism of UAVs containing these sensors. Logical rules about which communication protocols to use also exist. Finally, various driving context cognition rules are provided. The result is a more reliable environment perception for the vehicle. When necessary, users are provided with driving assistance information, leading to safe driving and fewer road accidents.

Equipment maintenance management is facing significant challenges in terms of maintenance workload, system reliability and stability requirements and the overall skill requirements of maintenance personnel. Equipment maintenance management is also developing in the direction of intellectualization. It is important to have a method to construct a domain knowledge graph and to organize and utilize it. As is well known, traditional equipment maintenance is mainly dependent on technicians, and they are required to be very familiar with the maintenance manuals. But it is very difficult to manage and exploit a large quantity of knowledge for technicians in a short time. Hence a method to construct a knowledge graph (KG) for equipment maintenance is proposed to extract knowledge from manuals, and an effective maintenance scheme is obtained with this knowledge graph. Firstly, a joint model based on an enhanced BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF is put forward to extract knowledge automatically, and a Cosine and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) based on semantic similarity a presented to eliminate redundancy in the process of the knowledge fusion. Finally, a Decision Support System (DSS) for equipment maintenance is developed and implemented, in which knowledge can be extracted automatically and provide an equipment maintenance scheme according to the requirements. The experimental results show that the joint model used in this paper performs well on Chinese text related to equipment maintenance, with an F1 score of 0.847. The quality of the knowledge graph constructed after eliminating redundancy is also significantly improved. © 2023 by the authors.",BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF; knowledge graph; natural language processing; semantic similarity,,FALSE

How to use multimodal information to build an information management platform is a difficult problem. In this paper, a method is proposed to construct the result of image recognition as a knowledge graph. First of all, based on the improvement in the BlendMASK algorithm, the hollow convolution kernel is added. Secondly, the effect of image recognition and the relationships between all kinds of information are analyzed. Finally, the image knowledge graph is constructed by using the relationship between the image entities. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) The hollow convolution kernel is added to reduce the loss from extracting feature information from high-level feature images. (2) In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the relationship between entities by dividing the recognition results of entities in an image with a threshold, which makes it possible for the relationships between images to be interconnected. The experimental results show that this method improves the accuracy and F1 value of the image recognition algorithm.

Early representation learning mostly focused on the information contained in the triplet itself but ignored other useful information. Since entities have different types of representations in different scenarios, the rich information in the types of entity levels is helpful for obtaining a more complete knowledge representation. In this paper, a new knowledge representation frame (TRKRL) combining rule path information and entity hierarchical type information is proposed to exploit interpretability of logical rules and the advantages of entity hierarchical types. Specifically, for entity hierarchical type information, we consider that entities have multiple representations of different types, as well as treat it as the projection matrix of entities, using the type encoder to model entity hierarchical types. For rule path information, we mine Horn rules from the knowledge graph to guide the synthesis of relations in paths. Experimental results show that TRKRL outperforms baselines on the knowledge graph completion task, which indicates that our model is capable of using entity hierarchical type information, relation paths information, and logic rules information for representation learning. © 2020 by the authors.

However, with the increase in landslide monitoring data, the available multimodal landslide data contain rich feature information, and existing landslide recognition models have difficulty utilizing such data. A knowledge graph is a linguistic network knowledge base capable of storing and describing various entities and their relationships. A landslide knowledge graph is used to manage multimodal landslide data, and by integrating this graph into a landslide image recognition model, the given multimodal landslide data can be fully utilized for landslide identification. In this paper, we combine knowledge and models, introduce the use of landslide knowledge graphs in landslide identification, and propose a landslide identification method for remote sensing images that fuses knowledge graphs and ResNet (FKGRNet). We take the Loess Plateau of China as the study area and test the effect of the fusion model by comparing the baseline model, the fusion model and other deep learning models. The experimental results show that, first, with ResNet34 as the baseline model, the FKGRNet model achieves 95.08% accuracy in landslide recognition, which is better than that of the baseline model and other deep learning models. Second, the FKGRNet model with different network depths has better landslide recognition accuracy than its corresponding baseline model. Third, the FKGRNet model based on feature splicing outperforms the fused feature classifier in terms of both accuracy and F1-score on the landslide recognition task.

As one of the most widely used methods for tracking fire, remote sensing can provide valuable information about fires, but it is not always available, and needs to be supplemented by data from other sources. Social media is an emerging but underutilized data source for emergency management, contains a wealth of disaster information, and reflects the public’s real-time witness and feedback to fires. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework of multi-source data analysis, including social media data and remote sensing data, cellphone signaling data, terrain data, and meteorological data to track WUI fires. Using semantic web technology, the framework has been implemented as a Knowledge Base Service and runs on top of WUIFire ontology. WUIFire ontology represents WUI fire–related knowledge and consists of three modules: system, monitoring, and spread, and tracks wildfires happening in WUIs. It provides a basis for tracking and analyzing a WUI fire by fusing multi-source data. To showcase the utility of our approach in a real-world scenario, we take the fire in the Yaji Mountain Scenic Area, Beijing, China, in 2019 as a case study. With object information identified from remote sensing, fire situation information extracted from Weibo, and fire perimeters constructed through fire spread simulation, a knowledge graph is constructed and an analysis using a semantic query is carried out to realize situational awareness and determine countermeasures.

It employs a semantic ontology framework to achieve the organic fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data, including remote sensing data, meteorological data, farmland data, crop information, etc. And it formalizes expert knowledge and computational models into knowledge inference rules, thereby enabling monitoring, early warning, and disaster analysis of agricultural crops within the observed area.

The method is tested using simulation monitoring, early warning, and impact calculation of the past two occurrences of dry hot wind disasters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide more specific and accurate warning information and post-disaster analysis results compared to raw records. The statistical results of NDVI decline also validate the correlation between the severity of wheat damage caused by dry hot winds and the intensity and duration of their occurrences.

This enriched information helps users better understand such events, at the same time providing a more satisfactory experience.

The ultimate goal of this paper is to improve the quality of HRI, developing a new dialog manager system that incorporates enriched information from the semantic web. This work presents the augmented robotic dialog system (ARDS), which uses natural language understanding mechanisms to provide two features: (i) a non-grammar multimodal input (verbal and/or written) text; and (ii) a contextualization of the information conveyed in the interaction. This contextualization is achieved by information enrichment techniques that link the extracted information from the dialog with extra information about the world available in semantic knowledge bases. This enriched or contextualized information (information enrichment, semantic enhancement or contextualized information are used interchangeably in the rest of this paper) offers many possibilities in terms of HRI. For instance, it can enhance the robot’s pro-activeness during a human–robot dialog (the enriched information can be used to propose new topics during the dialog, while ensuring a coherent interaction). Another possibility is to display additional multimedia content related to the enriched information on a visual device.

The process of recognizing human activities generally involves deploying a set of obtrusive and unobtrusive sensors, pre-processing the raw data, and building classification models using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Integrating data from multiple sensors is a challenging task due to dynamic nature of data sources. This is further complicated due to semantic and syntactic differences in these data sources. These differences become even more complex if the data generated is imperfect, which ultimately has a direct impact on its usefulness in yielding an accurate classifier. In this study, we propose a semantic imputation framework to improve the quality of sensor data using ontology-based semantic similarity learning. This is achieved by identifying semantic correlations among sensor events through SPARQL queries, and by performing a time-series longitudinal imputation. Furthermore, we applied deep learning (DL) based artificial neural network (ANN) on public datasets to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed approach.

The connections between species are explicit and objective and can be organized into a knowledge graph (KG). It is a challenging task to mine features of known categories from KG and to reason on unknown categories. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has recently been viewed as a potential approach to zero-shot learning. GCN enables knowledge transfer by sharing the statistical strength of nodes in the graph. More layers of graph convolution are stacked in order to aggregate the hierarchical information in the KG. However, the Laplacian over-smoothing problem will be severe as the number of GCN layers deepens, which leads the features between nodes toward a tendency to be similar and degrade the performance of zero-shot image classification tasks. We consider two parts to mitigate the Laplacian over-smoothing problem, namely reducing the invalid node aggregation and improving the discriminability among nodes in the deep graph network. We propose a top-k graph pooling method based on the self-attention mechanism to control specific node aggregation, and we introduce a dual structural symmetric knowledge graph additionally to enhance the representation of nodes in the latent space. Finally, we apply these new concepts to the recently widely used contrastive learning framework and propose a novel Contrastive Graph U-Net with two Attention-based graph pooling (Att-gPool) layers, CGUN-2A, which explicitly alleviates the Laplacian over-smoothing problem. To evaluate the performance of the method on complex real-world scenes, we test it on the large-scale zero-shot image classification dataset. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of allowing nodes to perform specific aggregation, as well as homogeneous graph comparison, in our deep graph network.

Firstly, a multi-source data-processing strategy was developed according to the needs of seismic impact analysis of the cultural relics in the collection, and a seismic event-ontology model of cultural relics was constructed. Additionally, a seismic damage data-classification acquisition method and empirical calculation model were designed.

We have developed an integrated and automated methodology that leverages a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to generate scenario-based ontologies and knowledge graphs from research articles and technical manuals. Our methodology utilizes the ChatGPT API as the primary reasoning engine, supplemented by Natural Language Processing modules and carefully engineered prompts. This combination enables an automated tool capable of generating ontologies independently. The ontologies generated through our AI-powered method are interoperable and can significantly facilitate the design of data models and software architecture, particularly in the development of urban decision support systems. What is the implication of the main finding? We compared ontologies generated by our LLM with those created by human experts through CQ-based qualitative evaluation, assessing the reliability and feasibility of our approach. The methodology has been successfully applied to intermodal freight data and simulations. This has allowed us to generate a scenario-based ontology and knowledge graph that enhances data discovery, integration, and management, thereby supporting network optimization and multiple criteria decision analysis. Our methodology is both generalizable and adaptive, enabling the automation of ontology generation to support the development of urban and environmental decision support systems across various disciplines. The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models into various optimization systems is on the rise. However, addressing complex urban and environmental management challenges often demands deep expertise in domain science and informatics. This expertise is essential for deriving data and simulation-driven insights that support informed decision-making. In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to create knowledge representations for supporting operations research. By adopting ChatGPT-4 API as the reasoning core, we outline an applied workflow that encompasses natural language processing, Methontology-based prompt tuning, and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), to automate the construction of scenario-based ontologies using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations. From these ontologies, knowledge graphs can be derived using widely adopted formats and protocols, guiding various tasks towards data-informed decision support. The performance of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that contrasts our AI-generated ontology with the widely recognized pizza ontology, commonly used in tutorials for popular ontology software. We conclude with a real-world case study on optimizing the complex system of multi-modal freight transportation. Our approach advances urban decision support systems by enhancing data and metadata modeling, improving data integration and simulation coupling, and guiding the development of decision support strategies and essential software components. © 2024 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; intermodal freight transportation; large language models; ontology; urban decision support system,,FALSE

Geospatial data plays an indispensable role in spatially informed analyses, while data in different areas are relatively iso-lated. Therefore, it is inadequate to use relational data in handling many semantic intricacies and retrieving geospatial data. In light of this, a heterogeneous retrieval method based on knowledge graph is proposed in this paper. There are three advantages of this method: (1) the semantic knowledge of geospatial data is considered; (2) more information required by users could be ob-tained; (3) data retrieval speed can be improved. Firstly, implicit semantic knowledge is studied and applied to construct a knowledge graph, integrating semantics in multi-source heterogeneous geo-spatial data. Then, the query expansion rules and the mappings between knowledge and database are designed to construct retrieval statements and obtain related spatial entities. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency are verified through comparative analysis and practices. The experiment indicates that the method could automatically construct database retrieval statements and retrieve more relevant data. Additionally, users could reduce the dependence on data storage mode and database Structured Query Language syntax.

In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph representation model with a symmetric architecture called Joint Knowledge Representation Learning of Text Description and Knowledge Graph (JKRL), which models the entity description and relationship description of the triple structure for joint representation learning of knowledge and balances the contribution of the triple structure and text description in the process of vector learning. First, we adopt the TransE model to learn the structural vector representations of entities and relations, and then use a CNN model to encode the entity description to obtain the text representation of the entity. To semantically encode the relation descriptions, we designed an Attention-Bi-LSTM text encoder, which introduces an attention mechanism into the Bi-LSTM model to calculate the semantic relevance between each word in the sentence and different relations. In addition, we also introduce position features into word features in order to better encode word order information.

Moreover, the manual labeling process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We previously implemented a generative adversarial network-based method to reduce labeling costs. However, it does not consider fitness among more species. Methods of selecting the most suitable source domain dataset based on the fruit datasets of the target domain remain to be investigated. Moreover, current automatic labeling technology still requires manual labeling of the source domain dataset and cannot completely eliminate manual processes. Therefore, an improved EasyDAM_V3 model was proposed in this study as an automatic labeling method for additional classes of fruit. This study proposes both an optimal source domain establishment method based on a multidimensional spatial feature model to select the most suitable source domain, and a high-volume dataset construction method based on transparent background fruit image translation by constructing a knowledge graph of orchard scene hierarchy component synthesis rules. The EasyDAM_V3 model can automatically obtain fruit label information from the dataset, thereby eliminating manual labeling.

In this vein, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT epitomize the pre-training of extensive, sequence-based world knowledge into neural networks, facilitating the processing and manipulation of this knowledge in a parametric space. This article explores large models through the lens of “knowledge”. We initially investigate the role of symbolic knowledge such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in enhancing LLMs, covering aspects like knowledge-augmented language model, structure-inducing pretraining, knowledgeable prompts, structured CoT, knowledge editing, semantic tools for LLM and knowledgeable AI agents. Subsequently, we examine how LLMs can boost traditional symbolic knowledge bases, encompassing aspects like using LLM as KG builder and controller, structured knowledge pretraining, and LLM-enhanced symbolic reasoning. Considering the intricate nature of human knowledge, we advocate for the creation of Large Knowledge Models (LKM), specifically engineered to manage diversified spectrum of knowledge structures. This promising undertaking would entail several key challenges, such as disentangling knowledge base from language models, cognitive alignment with human knowledge, integration of perception and cognition, and building large commonsense models for interacting with physical world, among others. We finally propose a five-“A” principle to distinguish the concept of LKM. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Knowledge Augmentation; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Representation; Large Knowledge Model; Large Language Model,Semantics; Knowledge augmentation; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge model; Knowledge-representation; Language model; Large knowledge model; Large language model; Perception and cognition; Pre-training; World knowledge; Knowledge graph,FALSE

The defect of existing VQA solutions is that they need to identify task-related information in the obtained pictures, questions, and knowledge graphs. It is necessary to properly fuse and embed the information between different modes identified, to reduce the noise and dificulty in cross-modality reasoning of VQA models. However, this process of rationally integrating information between different modes and joint reasoning to find relevant evidence to correctly predict the answer to the question still deserves further study. This paper proposes a bimodal Graph Neural Network model combining pre-trained Language Models and Knowledge Graphs (BIGNN-LM-KG). Researchers built the concepts graph by the images and questions concepts separately. In constructing the concept graph, we used the combined reasoning advantages of LM+KG. Specifically, use KG to jointly infer the images and question entity concepts to build a concept graph. Use LM to calculate the correlation score to screen the nodes and paths of the concept graph. Then, we form a visual graph from the visual and spatial features of the filtered image entities. We use the improved GNN to learn the representation of the two graphs and to predict the most likely answer by fusing the information of two different modality graphs using a modality fusion GNN. On the common dataset of VQA, the model we proposed obtains good experiment results. It also verifies the validity of each component in the model and the interpretability of the model. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Researchers have mainly focused on improving the ability of the model's visual feature extractor to address this problem. However, there are few researches focused on the textual feature extraction, and most of them underestimated the interactions between corresponding visual and textual features. In this study, we propose a corresponding feature fusion (CFF) method to strengthen the interactions of specific features from corresponding radiology images and questions. In addition, we designed a semantic attention (SA) module for textual feature extraction. This helps the model consciously focus on the meaningful words in various questions while reducing the attention spent on insignificant information.

The general medical knowledge graph tries to include all diseases and contains much medical knowledge. However, it is challenging to review all the triples manually. Therefore the quality of the knowledge graph can not support intelligence medical applications. Breast cancer is one of the highest incidences of cancer at present. It is urgent to improve the efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment through artificial intelligence technology and improve the postoperative health status of breast cancer patients. This paper proposes a framework to construct a breast cancer knowledge graph from heterogeneous data resources in response to this demand. Specifically, this paper extracts knowledge triple from clinical guidelines, medical encyclopedias and electronic medical records. Furthermore, the triples from different data resources are fused to build a breast cancer knowledge graph (BCKG).

However, knowledge graphs often suffer from the problem of incompleteness due to the infinite and constantly updating nature of knowledge, and thus the task of knowledge graph completion has been proposed. Existing multi-modal knowledge graph completion methods mostly rely on either embedding-based representations or graph neural networks, and there is still room for improvement in terms of interpretability and the ability to handle multi-hop tasks. Therefore, we propose a new method for multi-modal knowledge graph completion. Our method aims to learn multi-level graph structural features to fully explore hidden relationships within the knowledge graph and to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, we first use a Transformer architecture to separately learn about data representations for both the image and text modalities. Then, with the help of multimodal gating units, we filter out irrelevant information and perform feature fusion to obtain a unified encoding of knowledge representations. Furthermore, we extract multi-level path features using a width-adjustable sliding window and learn about structural feature information in the knowledge graph using graph convolutional operations. Finally, we use a scoring function to evaluate the probability of the truthfulness of encoded triplets and to complete the prediction task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets, FB15K-237-IMG and WN18-IMG, and achieve improvements of 1.8 and 0.7%, respectively, in the Hits@1 metric. © 2023 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Most of the existing approaches learn the representation from the structural information in the triples, which neglects the content related to the entity and relation. Though there are some approaches proposed to exploit the related multimodal content to improve knowledge graph embedding, such as the text description and images associated with the entities, they are not effective to address the heterogeneity and cross-modal correlation constraint of different types of content and network structure. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal content fusion model (MMCF) for knowledge graph embedding. To effectively fuse the heterogenous data for knowledge graph embedding, such as text description, related images and structural information, a cross-modal correlation learning component is proposed. It first learns the intra-modal and inter-modal correlation to fuse the multimodal content of each entity, and then they are fused with the structure features by a gating network. Meanwhile, to enhance the features of relation, the features of the associated head entity and tail entity are fused to learn relation embedding. To effectively evaluate the proposed model, we compare it with other baselines in three datasets, i.e., FB-IMG, WN18RR and FB15k-237.

The proposed approach utilizes various entity information based on marine domain experts to enrich the semantic content of the knowledge graph. To enhance named entity recognition accuracy, we propose a novel TrellisNet-CRF model. Our experiment results demonstrate that the TrellisNet-CRF model reached a 96.99% accuracy rate for marine domain named entity recognition, which outperforms the current state-of the art baseline. The effectiveness of the TrellisNet-CRF module was then further demonstrated and confirmed on entity recognition and visualization tasks. © Copyright 2022 Wu et al.",Entity recognition; Knowledge graph; Marine expert; Trellisnet-crf,Domain Knowledge; Graphic methods; Semantics; Domain specific; Entity recognition; Expert management; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Marine expert; Marine science; Named entity recognition; Research institutions; Trellisnet-crf; Knowledge graph,FALSE

Considering the relative position between entity pairs and the influence of sentence level information on the performance of relationship extraction model, this article proposes a BERT-PAGG relationship extraction model. The model introduces the location information of entities, and combines the local features extracted by PAGG module with the entity vector representation output by BERT. Specifically, BERT-PAGG integrates entity location information into local features through segmented convolution neural network, uses attention mechanism to capture more effective semantic features, and finally regulates the transmission of information flow through gating mechanism. Experimental results on two open Chinese relation extraction datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best results compared with other models.

Uni-modal NER and RE approaches solely rely on text information for knowledge extraction, leading to various limitations, such as suboptimal performance and low efficiency in recognizing polysemous words. With the development of multi-modal learning, multi-modal named entity recognition (MNER) and multi-modal relation extraction (MRE) have been introduced to improve recognition performance. However, existing MNER and MRE methods often encounter reduced efficiency when the text includes unrelated images. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-modal network framework for named entity recognition and relation extraction called RSRNeT. In RSRNeT, we focus on extracting visual features more fully and designing a multi-scale visual feature extraction module based on ResNeSt network. On the other hand, we also emphasize fusing multi-modal features more comprehensively while minimizing interference from irrelevant images. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal feature fusing module based on RoBERTa network. These two modules enable us to learn superior visual and textual representations, reducing errors caused by irrelevant images.

This study proposes a deep recommendation system algorithm based on a knowledge graph (D-KGR) that includes four data processing units. These units are the recommendation unit (RS unit), the knowledge graph feature representation unit (KGE unit), the cross compression unit (CC unit), and the feature extraction unit (FE unit). This model integrates technologies including the knowledge graph, deep learning, neural network, and data mining. It introduces cross compression in the feature learning process of the knowledge graph and predicts user attributes. Multimodal technology is used to optimize the process of project attribute processing; text type attributes, multivalued type attributes, and other type attributes are processed separately to reconstruct the knowledge graph. A convolutional neural network algorithm is introduced in the reconstruction process to optimize the data feature qualities. Experimental analysis was conducted from two aspects of algorithm efficiency and accuracy, and the particle swarm optimization, neural network, and knowledge graph algorithms were compared. Several tests showed that the deep recommendation system algorithm had obvious advantages when the number of learning resources and users exceeded 1,000. It has the ability to integrate systems such as the particle swarm optimization iterative classification, neural network intelligent simulation, and low resource consumption. It can quickly process massive amounts of information data, reduce algorithm complexity and requires less time and had lower costs.

The reason being, entities and relations in the knowledge graph can be represented as embedding vectors in semantic space, and these embedding vectors have been used to predict relationships between entities. Such knowledge graph embedding methods provide a practical approach to data analytics and increase chances of building machine learning models with high prediction accuracy that can enhance decision support systems.

We systematically investigated and compared state-of-the-art embedding methods based on the design settings used for training and evaluation. We further tested various strategies aimed at controlling the amount of information related to each relation in the knowledge graph and its effects on the final performance. We also assessed the quality of the knowledge graph features through clustering and visualization and employed several evaluation metrics to examine their uses and differences.

The next an inference method based on weighted path ranking on the knowledge graph is proposed to score the related entities according to the key information and intention of a given question. Finally, it extracts the inferred candidate entities to construct answers.

In a real recommendation scenario, all the effective information in a data set should be extracted, both explicit and implicit, because the comprehensive degree of information is proportional to the recommendation performance. This article proposes an enhanced multi-modal recommendation based on alternate training with knowledge graph representation (SI-MKR) based on the MKR deep learning recommendation model. Our framework is an enhanced recommendation system based on knowledge graph representation, using valuable external knowledge as multi-modal information. The SI-MKR model solves the problem of ignoring the diversity of data types in the multi-modal knowledge-based recommendation system, which adds user and item attribute information from a knowledge graph as an enhancement recommendation multi-tasking training. By analysing the content of the item and user attributes, the SI-MKR model classifies the attributes of the items and users, processes the text type attributes and multi-value type attributes separately for feature extraction, and other types of attributes are used as inputs to the knowledge graph embedding unit. In addition, the knowledge graph data form a triplet unit, thus continuing the knowledge graph data training process. The feature extraction unit of the knowledge graph and the recommended unit are connected through the cross-compression unit for alternate training. During the deep learning framework training process, the recommendation system's item has a potential correlation with the head entity in the knowledge graph which embodies the idea of multi-tasking. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SI-MKR achieves substantial gains in movie recommendation over advanced model baselines. Even user-item interactions are sparse, SI-MKR maintains better performance than the MKR model. © 2013 IEEE.",Knowledge graph,,FALSE

With the advent of Artificial Intelligence, we can now explore relationships across areas (e.g., mechanics-biology) or disparate domains (e.g., failure mechanics-art). To achieve this, we use a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), here for a subset of knowledge in multiscale materials failure. The approach includes the use of a general-purpose LLM to distill question-answer pairs from raw sources followed by LLM fine-tuning. The resulting MechGPTLLMfoundation model is used in a series of computational experiments to explore its capacity for knowledge retrieval, various language tasks, hypothesis generation, and connecting knowledge across disparate areas. While the model has some ability to recall knowledge from training, we find that LLMs are particularly useful for extracting structural insights through Ontological Knowledge Graphs. These interpretable graph structures provide explanatory insights, frameworks for new research questions, and visual representations of knowledge that also can be used in retrieval-augmented generation. Three versions of MechGPT are discussed, featuring different sizes from 13×109 to 70×109 parameters, and reaching context lengths of more than 10,000 tokens.

One of the problems with this framework is that questions with incorrect content might be selected, which often occurs when the link prediction performance is low, and this would reduce the users' willingness to engage in dialogues. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents two modifications to the KGC training: 1) creating pseudo entities having substrings of the names of the entities in the graph so that the entities whose names share substrings are connected and 2) limiting the range of negative sampling. Cross validation-based experiments we conducted showed that these modifications improved KGC performance.

Scholarly knowledge graphs have the potential to address these challenges. However, creating such graphs remains a complex task. We propose a method to crowdsource structured scholarly knowledge from paper authors with a web-based user interface supported by artificial intelligence. The interface enables authors to select key sentences for annotation. It integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to assist authors during the annotation, including class recommendation and key sentence highlighting. We envision that the interface is integrated in paper submission processes for which we define three main task requirements: The task has to be . We evaluated the interface with a user study in which participants were assigned the task to annotate one of their own articles. With the resulting data, we determined whether the participants were successfully able to perform the task. Furthermore, we evaluated the interface's usability and the participant's attitude towards the interface with a survey. The results suggest that sentence annotation is a feasible task for researchers and that they do not object to annotate their articles during the submission process. © 2021 Owner/Author.",Crowdsourcing,,FALSE
"Markchom, Thanet (1); Liang, Huizhi (1) ",Augmenting Visual Information in Knowledge Graphs for Recommendations,10.1145/3397481.3450686,"International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, Proceedings IUI",Engineering Village,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been popularly used in recommender systems to leverage high-order connections between users and items. Typically, KGs are constructed based on semantic information derived from metadata. However, item images are also highly useful, especially for those domains where visual factors are influential such as fashion items. In this paper, we propose an approach to augment visual information extracted by popularly used image feature extraction methods into KGs. Specifically, we introduce visually-augmented KGs where the extracted information is integrated by using visual factor entities and visual relations. Moreover, to leverage the augmented KGs, a user representation learning approach is proposed to learn hybrid user profiles that combine both semantic and visual preferences. The proposed approaches have been applied in top-N recommendation tasks on two real-world datasets. The results show that the augmented KGs and the representation learning approach can improve the recommendation performance. They also show that the augmented KGs are applicable in the state-of-the-art KG-based recommender system as well. © 2021 ACM.",Knowledge graph,,FALSE

This framework introduces software modules that transform large-scale RDF data into ML-ready fixed-length numeric feature vectors. The developed modules are optimized to the multi-modal nature of knowledge graphs. DistRDF2ML provides aligned software design and usage principles as common data science stacks that offer an easy-to-use package for creating machine learning pipelines. The modules used in the pipeline, the hyper-parameters and the results are exported as a semantic structure that can be used to enrich the original knowledge graph. The semantic representation of metadata and machine learning results offers the advantage of increasing the machine learning pipelines' reusability, explainability, and reproducibility. The entire framework of DistRDF2ML is open source, integrated into the holistic SANSA stack, documented in scala-docs, and covered by unit tests. DistRDF2ML demonstrates its scalable design across different processing power configurations and (hyper-)parameter setups within various experiments. The framework brings the three worlds of knowledge graph engineers, distributed computation developers, and data scientists closer together and offers all of them the creation of explainable ML pipelines using a few lines of code. © 2021 ACM.",Semantics,,FALSE

To fight knowledge fragmentation, collective intelligence leverages groups of experts (possibly from diverse domains) that jointly provide solutions. However, to promote beneficial outcomes and avoid herding, it is necessary to (i) elicit diverse responses and (ii) suitably aggregate them in a collective solution. To this end, AI can help with dealing with large knowledge bases, as well as with reasoning on expert-provided knowledge to support decision-making. A hybrid human-artificial collective intelligence can leverage the complementarity of expert knowledge and machine processing to deal with complex problems. We discuss how such a hybrid human-artificial collective intelligence can be deployed to support decision processes, and we present case studies in two different domains: general medical diagnostics and climate change adaptation management. © 2023 The Authors.",Decision support systems,,FALSE

Within organizations, there is, on the one hand, explicit knowledge that is easy to capture, represent, and share. On the other hand, there is tacit knowledge possessed and acquired by individuals during their activities. Unlike explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge is difficult to capture and formalize. Organizations have granted more interest and efforts in representing, sharing, and reasoning from explicit knowledge. However, for tacit personal knowledge, they rely on methods such as meetings, mentoring, questions answering, or interviews which are limited in capitalizing on personal knowledge. This study elaborates on the construction of interpersonal activity graphs for representing, sharing, and reasoning on organizations' tacit knowledge possessed by individuals. The established graph is based on an extended activity theory framework and an ontology for common semantics. The proposed representation captures tacit knowledge in a graph form, making it shareable while offering means to reason and query it. © 2023 The Authors.",Knowledge management,,FALSE
"Zhang, Bohui (1); Peñuela, Albert Meroño (1); Simperl, Elena (1) ",Towards Explainable Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction with Human-in-the- Loop,10.3233/FAIA230091,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,Engineering Village,"Knowledge graphs are important in human-centered AI because of their ability to reduce the need for large labelled machine-learning datasets, facilitate transfer learning, and generate explanations. However, knowledge-graph construction has evolved into a complex, semi-automatic process that increasingly relies on opaque deep-learning models and vast collections of heterogeneous data sources to scale. The knowledge-graph lifecycle is not transparent, accountability is limited, and there are no accounts of, or indeed methods to determine, how fair a knowledge graph is in the downstream applications that use it. Knowledge graphs are thus at odds with AI regulation, for instance the EU's upcoming AI Act, and with ongoing efforts elsewhere in AI to audit and debias data and algorithms. This paper reports on work in progress towards designing explainable (XAI) knowledge-graph construction pipelines with human-in-the-loop and discusses research topics in this space. These were grounded in a systematic literature review, in which we studied tasks in knowledge-graph construction that are often automated, as well as common methods to explain how they work and their outcomes. We identified three directions for future research: (i) tasks in knowledge-graph construction where manual input remains essential and where there may be opportunities for AI assistance; (ii) integrating XAI methods into established knowledge-engineering practices to improve stakeholder experience; as well as (iii) evaluating how effective explanations genuinely are in making knowledge-graph construction more trustworthy. © 2023 The Authors.",Knowledge graph,,FALSE

With the aim of improving the work of human assistants, we developed a collaborative bot (cobot) to help them in the process of handling customer voice interactions. The cobot is a reasoning agent that starts from loading background customer data into a dynamic knowledge graph. Then it captures the audio stream of the conversation, converts it to text in real time, analyzes the blocks of conversation with neural technologies and 'thinks' about the results. Assistants can also supply data to the cobot, based on the information they gather from the ongoing conversation. The reasoning agent provides information and action suggestions to the human assistant by applying heuristics on data collected from both automatic and human sources, based on a task and domain-specific conceptual models (ontologies). While designing a prototypical solution for utility services in Italy, we are faced with many problems, including spontaneous speech understanding, factual and linguistic knowledge representation, and efficient heuristic reasoning. We adopted a standards-based approach and experimented with open source reasoners and publicly available language models.

"Palma, Cosimo (1, 2) ",Neurosymbolic Narrative Generation for Cultural Heritage,10.3233/FAIA230129,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,Engineering Village,"Aim of my research is to exploit Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) as base for advanced Cultural Heritage (CH) fruition by means of Automatic Story Generation (ASG). Following the rationale that discovering and reviving already existing (yet latent) narratives is worthier than automatically generating them from anew in eliciting the user's interest, the input-2-graph and the graph-2-sequence ASG-pipeline phases, heavily relying on LLOD, will be given a deeper focus, whereby the final Natural Language Generation (NLG) module will be constrained by the entities and relations established in the Knowledge Graph (KG) generation modules (a configuration typical of the neurosymbolic approach). In order to enhance possibilities of implementation in real-life contexts, the elaborated pipeline will be modular, i.e. self-sufficient in its constituent parts. Beyond the countless possible application scenarios ranging from education to entertainment, this solution detangles the user from his role of mere consumer, and empowers him not only to control the creation process [3.1], but also to find already within it, and not necessarily in the final outcome, a valuable source for intellectual growth.
